<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

  <p>Since the work of Davies appeared in 1725, no English scholar has
  edited the <i>Academica</i>. In Germany the last edition with explanatory
  notes is that of Goerenz, published in 1810. To the poverty and
  untrustworthiness of Goerenz's learning Madvig's pages bear strong
  evidence; while the work of Davies, though in every way far superior to
  that of Goerenz, is very deficient when judged by the criticism of the
  present time.</p>

  <p>This edition has grown out of a course of Intercollegiate lectures
  given by me at Christ's College several years ago. I trust that the work
  in its present shape will be of use to undergraduate students of the
  Universities, and also to pupils and teachers alike in all schools where
  the philosophical works of Cicero are studied, but especially in those
  where an attempt is made to impart such instruction in the Ancient
  Philosophy as will prepare the way for the completer knowledge now
  required in the final Classical Examinations for Honours both at Oxford
  and Cambridge. My notes have been written throughout with a practical
  reference to the needs of junior students. During the last three or four
  years I have read the <i>Academica</i> with a large number of intelligent
  pupils, and there is scarcely a note of mine which has not been suggested
  by some difficulty or want of theirs. My plan has been, first, to embody
  in an Introduction such information concerning Cicero's philosophical
  views and the literary history of the <i>Academica</i> as could not be
  readily got from existing books; next, to provide a good text; then to
  aid the student in obtaining a higher knowledge of Ciceronian Latinity,
  and lastly, to put it in his power to learn thoroughly the philosophy
  with which Cicero deals.</p>

  <p>My text may be said to be founded on that of Halm which appeared in
  the edition of Cicero's philosophical works published in 1861 under the
  editorship of Baiter and Halm as a continuation of Orelli's second
  edition of Cicero's works, which was interrupted by the death of that
  editor. I have never however allowed one of Halm's readings to pass
  without carefully weighing the evidence he presents; and I have also
  studied all original criticisms upon the text to which I could obtain
  access. The result is a text which lies considerably nearer the MSS. than
  that of Halm. My obligations other than those to Halm are sufficiently
  acknowledged in my notes; the chief are to Madvig's little book entitled
  <i>Emendationes ad Ciceronis libros Philosophicos</i>, published in 1825
  at Copenhagen, but never, I believe, reprinted, and to Baiter's text in
  the edition of Cicero's works by himself and Kayser. In a very few
  passages I have introduced emendations of my own, and that only where the
  conjecttires of other Editors seemed to me to depart too widely from the
  MSS. If any apology be needed for discussing, even sparingly, in the
  notes, questions of textual criticism, I may say that I have done so from
  a conviction that the very excellence of the texts now in use is
  depriving a Classical training of a great deal of its old educational
  value. The judgment was better cultivated when the student had to fight
  his way through bad texts to the author's meaning and to a mastery of the
  Latin tongue. The acceptance of results without a knowledge of the
  processes by which they are obtained is worthless for the purposes of
  education, which is thus made to rest on memory alone. I have therefore
  done my best to place before the reader the arguments for and against
  different readings in the most important places where the text is
  doubtful.</p>

  <p>My experience as a teacher and examiner has proved to me that the
  students for whom this edition is intended have a far smaller
  acquaintance than they ought to have with the peculiarities and niceties
  of language which the best Latin writers display. I have striven to guide
  them to the best teaching of Madvig, on whose foundation every succeeding
  editor of Cicero must build. His edition of the <i>De Finibus</i>
  contains more valuable material for illustrating, not merely the
  language, but also the subject-matter of the <i>Academica</i>, than all
  the professed editions of the latter work in existence. Yet, even after
  Madvig's labours, a great deal remains to be done in pointing out what
  is, and what is not, Ciceronian Latin. I have therefore added very many
  references from my own reading, and from other sources. Wherever a
  quotation would not have been given but for its appearance in some other
  work, I have pointed out the authority from whom it was taken. I need
  hardly say that I do not expect or intend readers to look out all the
  references given. It was necessary to provide material by means of which
  the student might illustrate for himself a Latin usage, if it were new to
  him, and might solve any linguistic difficulty that occurred. Want of
  space has compelled me often to substitute a mere reference for an actual
  quotation.</p>

  <p>As there is no important doctrine of Ancient Philosophy which is not
  touched upon somewhere in the <i>Academica</i>, it is evidently
  impossible for an editor to give information which would be complete for
  a reader who is studying that subject for the first time. I have
  therefore tried to enable readers to find easily for themselves the
  information they require, and have only dwelt in my own language upon
  such philosophical difficulties as were in some special way bound up with
  the <i>Academica</i>. The two books chiefly referred to in my notes are
  the English translation of Zeller's <i>Stoics, Epicureans and
  Sceptics</i> (whenever Zeller is quoted without any further description
  this book is meant), and the <i>Historia Philosophiae</i> of Ritter and
  Preller. The <i>pages</i>, not the <i>sections</i>, of the fourth edition
  of this work are quoted. These books, with Madvig's <i>De Finibus</i>,
  all teachers ought to place in the hands of pupils who are studying a
  philosophical work of Cicero. Students at the Universities ought to have
  constantly at hand Diogenes Laertius, Stobaeus, and Sextus Empiricus, all
  of which have been published in cheap and convenient forms.</p>

  <p>Although this edition is primarily intended for junior students, it is
  hoped that it may not be without interest for maturer scholars, as
  bringing together much scattered information illustrative of the
  <i>Academica</i>, which was before difficult of access. The present work
  will, I hope, prepare the way for an exhaustive edition either from my
  own or some more competent hand. It must be regarded as an experiment,
  for no English scholar of recent times has treated any portion of
  Cicero's philosophical works with quite the purpose which I have kept in
  view and have explained above. Should this attempt meet with favour, I
  propose to edit after the same plan some others of the less known and
  less edited portions of Cicero's writings.</p>

  <p>In dealing with a subject so unusually difficult and so rarely edited
  I cannot hope to have escaped errors, but after submitting my views to
  repeated revision during four years, it seems better to publish them than
  to withhold from students help they so greatly need. Moreover, it is a
  great gain, even at the cost of some errors, to throw off that
  intellectual disease of over-fastidiousness which is so prevalent in this
  University, and causes more than anything else the unproductiveness of
  English scholarship as compared with that of Germany,</p>

  <p>I have only to add that I shall be thankful for notices of errors and
  omissions from any who are interested in the subject.</p>

<h2>THE ACADEMICA OF CICERO.</h2>

<!-- Page i --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i"></a>[i]</span>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p class="center">I. <i>Cicero as a Student of Philosophy and Man of
Letters:</i> 90&mdash;45 B.C.</p>

  <p>It would seem that Cicero's love for literature was inherited from his
  father, who, being of infirm health, lived constantly at Arpinum, and
  spent the greater part of his time in study.<a name="NtA_1"></a><a
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> From him was probably derived that strong
  love for the old Latin dramatic and epic poetry which his son throughout
  his writings displays. He too, we may conjecture, led the young Cicero to
  feel the importance of a study of philosophy to serve as a corrective for
  the somewhat narrow rhetorical discipline of the time.<a
  name="NtA_2"></a><a href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Cicero's first systematic lessons in philosophy were given him by the
  Epicurean Phaedrus, then at Rome because of the unsettled state of
  Athens, whose lectures he attended at a very early age, even before he
  had assumed the toga virilis. The pupil seems to have been converted at
  once to the tenets of the <!-- Page ii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_ii"></a>[ii]</span> master.<a name="NtA_3"></a><a
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Phaedrus remained to the end of his life
  a friend of Cicero, who speaks warmly in praise of his teacher's amiable
  disposition and refined style. He is the only Epicurean, with, perhaps,
  the exception of Lucretius, whom the orator ever allows to possess any
  literary power.<a name="NtA_4"></a><a href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
  Cicero soon abandoned Epicureanism, but his schoolfellow, T. Pomponius
  Atticus, received more lasting impressions from the teaching of Phaedrus.
  It was probably at this period of their lives that Atticus and his friend
  became acquainted with Patro, who succeeded Zeno of Sidon as head of the
  Epicurean school.<a name="NtA_5"></a><a
  href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>At this time (i.e. before 88 B.C.) Cicero also heard the lectures of
  Diodotus the Stoic, with whom he studied chiefly, though not exclusively,
  the art of dialectic.<a name="NtA_6"></a><a
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> This art, which Cicero deems so important
  to the orator that he calls it "abbreviated eloquence," was then the
  monopoly of the Stoic school. For some time Cicero spent all his days
  with Diodotus in the severest study, but he seems never to have been much
  attracted by the general Stoic teaching. Still, the friendship between
  the two lasted till the death of Diodotus, who, according to a fashion
  set by the Roman Stoic circle of the time of Scipio and Laelius, became
  an inmate of Cicero's house, where he died in B.C. 59, leaving his pupil
  heir to a not inconsiderable property.<a name="NtA_7"></a><a
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> He seems to have been one of the most
  accomplished <!-- Page iii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_iii"></a>[iii]</span> men of his time, and Cicero's feelings
  towards him were those of gratitude, esteem, and admiration.<a
  name="NtA_8"></a><a href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the year 88 B.C. the celebrated Philo of Larissa, then head of the
  Academic school, came to Rome, one of a number of eminent Greeks who fled
  from Athens on the approach of its siege during the Mithridatic war.
  Philo, like Diodotus, was a man of versatile genius: unlike the Stoic
  philosopher, he was a perfect master both of the theory and the practice
  of oratory. Cicero had scarcely heard him before all inclination for
  Epicureanism was swept from his mind, and he surrendered himself wholly,
  as he tells us, to the brilliant Academic.<a name="NtA_9"></a><a
  href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Smitten with a marvellous enthusiasm he
  abandoned all other studies for philosophy. His zeal was quickened by the
  conviction that the old judicial system of Rome was overthrown for ever,
  and that the great career once open to an orator was now barred.<a
  name="NtA_10"></a><a href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We thus see that before Cicero was twenty years of age, he had been
  brought into intimate connection with at least three of the most eminent
  philosophers of the age, who represented the three most vigorous and
  important Greek schools. It is fair to conclude that he must have become
  thoroughly acquainted with their spirit, and with the main tenets of
  each. His own statements, after every deduction necessitated by his
  egotism has been made, leave no doubt about his diligence as a student.
  In his later works he often dwells on his youthful devotion to
  philosophy.<a name="NtA_11"></a><a href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> It
  would be unwise to lay too much stress on the intimate connection <!--
  Page iv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span> which
  subsisted between the rhetorical and the ethical teaching of the Greeks;
  but there can be little doubt that from the great rhetorician Molo, then
  Rhodian ambassador at Rome, Cicero gained valuable information concerning
  the ethical part of Greek philosophy.</p>

  <p>During the years 88&mdash;81 B.C., Cicero employed himself incessantly
  with the study of philosophy, law, rhetoric, and belles lettres. Many
  ambitious works in the last two departments mentioned were written by him
  at this period. On Sulla's return to the city after his conquest of the
  Marian party in Italy, judicial affairs once more took their regular
  course, and Cicero appeared as a pleader in the courts, the one
  philosophic orator of Rome, as he not unjustly boasts<a
  name="NtA_12"></a><a href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>. For two years he
  was busily engaged, and then suddenly left Rome for a tour in Eastern
  Hellas. It is usually supposed that he came into collision with Sulla
  through the freedman Chrysogonus, who was implicated in the case of
  Roscius. The silence of Cicero is enough to condemn this theory, which
  rests on no better evidence than that of Plutarch. Cicero himself, even
  when mentioning his speech in defence of Roscius, never assigns any other
  cause for his departure than his health, which was being undermined by
  his passionate style of oratory<a name="NtA_13"></a><a
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The whole two years 79&mdash;77 B.C. were spent in the society of
  Greek philosophers and rhetoricians. The first six months passed at
  Athens, and were almost entirely devoted to philosophy, since, with the
  exception <!-- Page v --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_v"></a>[v]</span> of Demetrius Syrus, there were no eminent
  rhetorical teachers at that time resident in the city<a
  name="NtA_14"></a><a href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. By the advice of
  Philo himself<a name="NtA_15"></a><a href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>,
  Cicero attended the lectures of that clear thinker and writer, as
  Diogenes calls him<a name="NtA_16"></a><a
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>, Zeno of Sidon, now the head of the
  Epicurean school. In Cicero's later works there are several references to
  his teaching. He was biting and sarcastic in speech, and spiteful in
  spirit, hence in striking contrast to Patro and Phaedrus<a
  name="NtA_17"></a><a href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>. It is curious to
  find that Zeno is numbered by Cicero among those pupils and admirers of
  Carneades whom he had known<a name="NtA_18"></a><a
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>. Phaedrus was now at Athens, and along
  with Atticus who loved him beyond all other philosophers<a
  name="NtA_19"></a><a href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>, Cicero spent much
  time in listening to his instruction, which was eagerly discussed by the
  two pupils<a name="NtA_20"></a><a href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>.
  Patro was probably in Athens at the same time, but this is nowhere
  explicitly stated. Cicero must at this time have attained an almost
  complete familiarity with the Epicurean doctrines.</p>

  <p>There seem to have been no eminent representatives of the Stoic school
  then at Athens. Nor is any mention made of a Peripatetic teacher whose
  lectures Cicero might have attended, though M. Pupius Piso, a professed
  Peripatetic, was one of his companions in this sojourn at Athens<a
  name="NtA_21"></a><a href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>. Only three
  notable Peripatetics were at this time living. Of these Staseas of
  Naples, who lived some time in Piso's house, was not then at Athens<a
  name="NtA_22"></a><a href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a>; it is probable,
  however, from a mention of <!-- Page vi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span> him in the De Oratore, that Cicero knew
  himm through Piso. Diodorus, the pupil of Critolaus, is frequently named
  by Cicero, but never as an acquaintance. Cratippus was at this time
  unknown to him.</p>

  <p>The philosopher from whose lessons Cicero certainly learned most at
  this period was Antiochus of Ascalon, now the representative of a
  Stoicised Academic school. Of this teacher, however, I shall have to
  treat later, when I shall attempt to estimate the influence he exercised
  over our author. It is sufficient here to say that on the main point
  which was in controversy between Philo and Antiochus, Cicero still
  continued to think with his earlier teacher. His later works, however,
  make it evident that he set a high value on the abilities and the
  learning of Antiochus, especially in dialectic, which was taught after
  Stoic principles. Cicero speaks of him as eminent among the philosophers
  of the time, both for talent and acquirement <a name="NtA_23"></a><a
  href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a>; as a man of acute intellect<a
  name="NtA_24"></a><a href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>; as possessed of a
  pointed style<a name="NtA_25"></a><a href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a>;
  in fine, as the most cultivated and keenest of the philosophers of the
  age<a name="NtA_26"></a><a href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>. A
  considerable friendship sprang up between Antiochus and Cicero<a
  name="NtA_27"></a><a href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a>, which was
  strengthened by the fact that many friends of the latter, such as Piso,
  Varro, Lucullus and Brutus, more or less adhered to the views of
  Antiochus. It is improbable that Cicero at this time became acquainted
  with Aristus the brother of Antiochus, since in the Academica<a
  name="NtA_28"></a><a href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> he is mentioned in
  such a way as to show that he was unknown to Cicero in B.C. 62.</p>

<!-- Page vii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
The main purpose of Cicero while at Athens had
been to learn philosophy; in Asia and at Rhodes he
devoted himself chiefly to rhetoric, under the guidance
of the most noted Greek teachers, chief of whom, was
his old friend Molo, the coryphaeus of the Rhodian
school<a name="NtA_29"></a><a href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>. Cicero, however, formed while at Rhodes one
friendship which largely influenced his views of philosophy,
that with Posidonius the pupil of Panaetius,
the most famous Stoic of the age. To him Cicero
makes reference in his works oftener than to any other
instructor. He speaks of him as the greatest of the
Stoics<a name="NtA_30"></a><a href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>; as a most notable philosopher, to visit whom
Pompey, in the midst of his eastern campaigns, put
himself to much trouble<a name="NtA_31"></a><a href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a>; as a minute inquirer<a name="NtA_32"></a><a href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>. He
is scarcely ever mentioned without some expression of
affection, and Cicero tells us that he read his works
more than those of any other author<a name="NtA_33"></a><a href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>. Posidonius
was at a later time resident at Rome, and stayed in
Cicero's house. Hecato the Rhodian, another pupil of
Panaetius, may have been at Rhodes at this time.
Mnesarchus and Dardanus, also hearers of Panaetius,
belonged to an earlier time, and although Cicero was
well acquainted with the works of the former, he does
not seem to have known either personally.

  <p>From the year 77 to the year 68 B.C., when the series of letters
  begins, Cicero was doubtless too busily engaged with legal and political
  affairs to spend much time in systematic study. That his oratory owed
  much to philosophy from the first he repeatedly insists; <!-- Page viii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span> and we
  know from his letters that it was his later practice to refresh his style
  by much study of the Greek writers, and especially the philosophers.
  During the period then, about which we have little or no information, we
  may believe that he kept up his old knowledge by converse with his many
  Roman friends who had a bent towards philosophy, as well as with the
  Greeks who from time to time came to Rome and frequented the houses of
  the Optimates; to this he added such reading as his leisure would allow.
  The letters contained in the first book of those addressed to Atticus,
  which range over the years 68&mdash;62 B.C., afford many proofs of the
  abiding strength of his passion for literary employment. In the earlier
  part of this time we find him entreating Atticus to let him have a
  library which was then for sale; expressing at the same time in the
  strongest language his loathing for public affairs, and his love for
  books, to which he looks as the support of his old age<a
  name="NtA_34"></a><a href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a>. In the midst of
  his busiest political occupations, when he was working his hardest for
  the consulship, his heart was given to the adornment of his Tusculan
  villa in a way suited to his literary and philosophic tastes. This may be
  taken as a specimen of his spirit throughout his life. He was before all
  things a man of letters; compared with literature, politics and oratory
  held quite a secondary place in his affections. Public business employed
  his intellect, but never his heart.</p>

  <p>The year 62 released him from the consulship and enabled him to
  indulge his literary tastes. To this year belong the publication of his
  speeches, which were <!-- Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span> crowded, he says, with the maxims of
  philosophy<a name="NtA_35"></a><a href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>; the
  history of his consulship, in Latin and Greek, the Greek version which he
  sent to Posidonius being modelled on Isocrates and Aristotle; and the
  poem on his consulship, of which some fragments remain. A year or two
  later we find him reading with enthusiasm the works of Dicaearchus, and
  keeping up his acquaintance with living Greek philosophers<a
  name="NtA_36"></a><a href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a>. His long lack of
  leisure seems to have caused an almost unquenchable thirst for reading at
  this time. His friend Paetus had inherited a valuable library, which he
  presented to Cicero. It was in Greece at the time, and Cicero thus writes
  to Atticus: "If you love me and feel sure of my love for you, use all the
  endeavours of your friends, clients, acquaintances, freedmen, and even
  slaves to prevent a single leaf from being lost.... Every day I find
  greater satisfaction in study, so far as my forensic labours permit<a
  name="NtA_37"></a><a href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a>." At this period
  of his life Cicero spent much time in study at his estates near Tusculum,
  Antium, Formiae, and elsewhere. I dwell with greater emphasis on these
  facts, because of the idea now spread abroad that Cicero was a mere
  dabbler in literature, and that his works were extempore paraphrases of
  Greek books half understood. In truth, his appetite for every kind of
  literature was insatiable, and his attainments in each department
  considerable. He was certainly the most learned Roman of his age, with
  the single exception of Varro. One of his letters to Atticus<a
  name="NtA_38"></a><a href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> will give a fair
  picture of his life at this time. He especially studied the political
  writings of <!-- Page x --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_x"></a>[x]</span> the Greeks, such as Theophrastus and
  Dicaearchus<a name="NtA_39"></a><a href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>. He
  also wrote historical memoirs after the fashion, of Theopompus<a
  name="NtA_40"></a><a href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The years from 59&mdash;57 B.C. were years in which Cicero's private
  cares overwhelmed all thought of other occupation. Soon after his return
  from exile, in the year 56, he describes himself as "devouring
  literature" with a marvellous man named Dionysius<a name="NtA_41"></a><a
  href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>, and laughingly pronouncing that
  nothing is sweeter than universal knowledge. He spent great part of the
  year 55 at Cumae or Naples "feeding upon" the library of Faustus Sulla,
  the son of the Dictator<a name="NtA_42"></a><a
  href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>. Literature formed then, he tells us,
  his solace and support, and he would rather sit in a garden seat which
  Atticus had, beneath a bust of Aristotle, than in the ivory chair of
  office. Towards the end of the year, he was busily engaged on the <i>De
  Oratore</i>, a work which clearly proves his continued familiarity with
  Greek philosophy<a name="NtA_43"></a><a
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>. In the following year (54) he writes
  that politics must cease for him, and that he therefore returns
  unreservedly to the life most in accordance with nature, that of the
  student<a name="NtA_44"></a><a href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>. During
  this year he was again for the most part at those of his country villas
  where his best collections of books were. At this time was written the
  <i>De Republica</i>, a work to which I may appeal for evidence that his
  old philosophical studies had by no means been allowed to drop<a
  name="NtA_45"></a><a href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a>. Aristotle is
  especially mentioned as one of the authors <!-- Page xi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span> read at this time<a
  name="NtA_46"></a><a href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a>. In the year 52
  B.C. came the <i>De Legibus</i>, written amid many distracting
  occupations; a work professedly modelled on Plato and the older
  philosophers of the Socratic schools.</p>

  <p>In the year 51 Cicero, then on his way to Cilicia, revisited Athens,
  much to his own pleasure and that of the Athenians. He stayed in the
  house of Aristus, the brother of Antiochus and teacher of Brutus. His
  acquaintance with this philosopher was lasting, if we may judge from the
  affectionate mention in the <i>Brutus</i><a name="NtA_47"></a><a
  href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a>. Cicero also speaks in kindly terms of
  Xeno, an Epicurean friend of Atticus, who was then with Patro at Athens.
  It was at this time that Cicero interfered to prevent Memmius, the pupil
  of the great Roman Epicurean Lucretius, from destroying the house in
  which Epicurus had lived<a name="NtA_48"></a><a
  href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a>. Cicero seems to have been somewhat
  disappointed with the state of philosophy at Athens, Aristus being the
  only man of merit then resident there<a name="NtA_49"></a><a
  href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a>. On the journey from Athens to his
  province, he made the acquaintance of Cratippus, who afterwards taught at
  Athens as head of the Peripatetic school<a name="NtA_50"></a><a
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a>. At this time he was resident at
  Mitylene, where Cicero seems to have passed some time in his society<a
  name="NtA_51"></a><a href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>. He was by far the
  greatest, Cicero said, of all the Peripatetics he had himself heard, and
  indeed equal in merit to the most eminent of that school<a
  name="NtA_52"></a><a href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The care of that disordered province Cilicia enough to employ Cicero's
  thoughts till the end of 50. <!-- Page xii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span> Yet he yearned for Athens and
  philosophy. He wished to leave some memorial of himself at the beautiful
  city, and anxiously asked Atticus whether it would look foolish to build
  a <span lang="el" title="propylon"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3C5;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span> at the
  Academia, as Appius, his predecessor, had done at Eleusis<a
  name="NtA_53"></a><a href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>. It seems the
  Athenians of the time were in the habit of adapting their ancient statues
  to suit the noble Romans of the day, and of placing on them fulsome
  inscriptions. Of this practice Cicero speaks with loathing. In one letter
  of this date he carefully discusses the errors Atticus had pointed out in
  the books <i>De Republica</i><a name="NtA_54"></a><a
  href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a>. His wishes with regard to Athens still
  kept their hold upon his mind, and on his way home from Cilicia he spoke
  of conferring on the city some signal favour<a name="NtA_55"></a><a
  href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a>. Cicero was anxious to show Rhodes,
  with its school of eloquence, to the two boys Marcus and Quintus, who
  accompanied him, and they probably touched there for a few days<a
  name="NtA_56"></a><a href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a>. From thence they
  went to Athens, where Cicero again stayed with Aristus<a
  name="NtA_57"></a><a href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>, and renewed his
  friendship with other philosophers, among them Xeno the friend of
  Atticus<a name="NtA_58"></a><a href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>On Cicero's return to Italy public affairs were in a very critical
  condition, and left little room for thoughts about literature. The
  letters which belong to this time are very pathetic. Cicero several times
  contrasts the statesmen of the time with the Scipio he had himself drawn
  in the <i>De Republica</i><a name="NtA_59"></a><a
  href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a>; when he thinks of Caesar, Plato's
  description of the tyrant is present to <!-- Page xiii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span> his mind<a
  name="NtA_60"></a><a href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>; when, he
  deliberates about the course he is himself to take, he naturally recals
  the example of Socrates, who refused to leave Athens amid the misrule of
  the thirty tyrants<a name="NtA_61"></a><a
  href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a>. It is curious to find Cicero, in the
  very midst of civil war, poring over the book of Demetrius the Magnesian
  concerning concord<a name="NtA_62"></a><a
  href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a>; or employing his days in arguing with
  himself a string of abstract philosophical propositions about tyranny<a
  name="NtA_63"></a><a href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a>. Nothing could
  more clearly show that he was really a man of books; by nothing but
  accident a politician. In these evil days, however, nothing was long to
  his taste; books, letters, study, all in their turn became unpleasant<a
  name="NtA_64"></a><a href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>As soon as Cicero had become fully reconciled to Caesar in the year 46
  he returned with desperate energy to his old literary pursuits. In a
  letter written to Varro in that year<a name="NtA_65"></a><a
  href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a>, he says "I assure you I had no sooner
  returned to Rome than I renewed my intimacy with my old friends, my
  books." These gave him real comfort, and his studies seemed to bear
  richer fruit than in his days of prosperity<a name="NtA_66"></a><a
  href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a>. The tenor of all his letters at this
  time is the same: see especially the remaining letters to Varro and also
  to Sulpicius<a name="NtA_67"></a><a href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a>.
  The <i>Partitiones Oratoriae</i>, the <i>Paradoxa</i>, the <i>Orator</i>,
  and the <i>Laudatio Catonis</i>, to which Caesar replied by his
  <i>Anticato</i>, were all finished within the year. Before the end of the
  year the <i>Hortensius</i> and the <i>De Finibus</i> had probably both
  been planned and commenced. <!-- Page xiv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span> Early in the following year the
  <i>Academica</i>, the history of which I shall trace elsewhere, was
  written.</p>

  <p>I have now finished the first portion of my task; I have shown Cicero
  as the man of letters and the student of philosophy during that portion
  of his life which preceded the writing of the <i>Academica</i>. Even the
  evidence I have produced, which does not include such indirect
  indications of philosophical study as might be obtained from the actual
  philosophical works of Cicero, is sufficient to justify his boast that at
  no time had he been divorced from philosophy<a name="NtA_68"></a><a
  href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a>. He was entitled to repel the charge
  made by some people on the publication of his first book of the later
  period&mdash;the <i>Hortensius</i>&mdash;that he was a mere tiro in
  philosophy, by the assertion that on the contrary nothing had more
  occupied his thoughts throughout the whole of a wonderfully energetic
  life<a name="NtA_69"></a><a href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a>. Did the
  scope of this edition allow it, I should have little difficulty in
  showing from a minute survey of his works, and a comparison of them with
  ancient authorities, that his knowledge of Greek philosophy was nearly as
  accurate as it was extensive. So far as the <i>Academica</i> is
  concerned, I have had in my notes an opportunity of defending Cicero's
  substantial accuracy; of the success of the defence I must leave the
  reader to judge. During the progress of this work I shall have to expose
  the groundlessness of many feelings and judgments now current which have
  contributed to produce a low estimate of Cicero's philosophical
  attainments, but there is one piece of unfairness which I shall have no
  better opportunity of mentioning <!-- Page xv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span> than the present. It is this. Cicero, the
  philosopher, is made to suffer for the shortcomings of Cicero the
  politician. Scholars who have learned to despise his political weakness,
  vanity, and irresolution, make haste to depreciate his achievements in
  philosophy, without troubling themselves to inquire too closely into
  their intrinsic value. I am sorry to be obliged to instance the
  illustrious Mommsen, who speaks of the <i>De Legibus</i> as "an oasis in
  the desert of this dreary and voluminous writer." From political
  partizanship, and prejudices based on facts irrelevant to the matter in
  hand, I beg all students to free themselves in reading the
  <i>Academica</i>.</p>

<p class="center">II. <i>The Philosophical Opinions of Cicero</i>.</p>

  <p>In order to define with clearness the position of Cicero as a student
  of philosophy, it would be indispensable to enter into a detailed
  historical examination of the later Greek schools&mdash;the Stoic,
  Peripatetic, Epicurean and new Academic. These it would be necessary to
  know, not merely as they came from the hands of their founders, but as
  they existed in Cicero's age; Stoicism not as Zeno understood it, but as
  Posidonius and the other pupils of Panaetius propounded it; not merely
  the Epicureanism of Epicurus, but that of Zeno, Phaedrus, Patro, and
  Xeno; the doctrines taught in the Lyceum by Cratippus; the new
  Academicism of Philo as well as that of Arcesilas and Carneades; the
  medley of Academicism, Peripateticism, and Stoicism put forward by
  Antiochus in the name of the Old <!-- Page xvi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span> Academy. A systematic
  attempt to distinguish between the earlier and later forms of doctrine
  held by these schools is still a great desideratum. Cicero's statements
  concerning any particular school are generally tested by comparing them
  with the assertions made by ancient authorities about the earlier
  representatives of the school. Should any discrepancy appear, it is at
  once concluded that Cicero is in gross error, whereas, in all
  probability, he is uttering opinions which would have been recognised as
  genuine by those who were at the head of the school in his day. The
  criticism of Madvig even is not free from this error, as will be seen
  from my notes on several passages of the <i>Academica</i><a
  name="NtA_70"></a><a href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a>. As my space
  forbids me to attempt the thorough inquiry I have indicated as desirable,
  I can but describe in rough outline the relation in which Cicero stands
  to the chief schools.</p>

  <p>The two main tasks of the later Greek philosophy were, as Cicero often
  insists, the establishment of a criterion such as would suffice to
  distinguish the true from the false, and the determination of an ethical
  standard<a name="NtA_71"></a><a href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a>. We
  have in the <i>Academica</i> Cicero's view of the first problem: that the
  attainment of any infallible criterion was impossible. To go more into
  detail here would be to anticipate the text of the <i>Lucullus</i> as
  well as my notes. Without further refinements, I may say that Cicero in
  this respect was in substantial agreement with the New Academic school,
  and in opposition to all other schools. As he himself says, the doctrine
  that absolute knowledge is impossible was the one Academic tenet against
  which all the other schools <!-- Page xvii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span> were combined<a name="NtA_72"></a><a
  href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a>. In that which was most distinctively
  New Academic, Cicero followed the New Academy.</p>

  <p>It is easy to see what there was in such a tenet to attract Cicero.
  Nothing was more repulsive to his mind than dogmatism. As an orator, he
  was accustomed to hear arguments put forward with equal persuasiveness on
  both sides of a case. It seemed to him arrogant to make any proposition
  with a conviction of its absolute, indestructible and irrefragable truth.
  One requisite of a philosophy with him was that it should avoid this
  arrogance<a name="NtA_73"></a><a href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a>.
  Philosophers of the highest respectability had held the most opposite
  opinions on the same subjects. To withhold absolute assent from all
  doctrines, while giving a qualified assent to those which seemed most
  probable, was the only prudent course<a name="NtA_74"></a><a
  href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a>. Cicero's temperament also, apart from
  his experience as an orator, inclined him to charity and toleration, and
  repelled him from the fury of dogmatism. He repeatedly insists that the
  diversities of opinion which the most famous intellects display, ought to
  lead men to teach one another with all gentleness and meekness<a
  name="NtA_75"></a><a href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a>. In positiveness
  of assertion there seemed to be something reckless and disgraceful,
  unworthy of a self-controlled character<a name="NtA_76"></a><a
  href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a>. Here we have a touch of feeling
  thoroughly Roman. Cicero further urges arguments similar to some put
  forward by a long series of English thinkers from Milton to Mill, to show
  that the free conflict of opinion is necessary <!-- Page xviii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span> to the progress
  of philosophy, which was by that very freedom brought rapidly to maturity
  in Greece<a name="NtA_77"></a><a href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>.
  Wherever authority has loudly raised its voice, says Cicero, there
  philosophy has pined. Pythagoras<a name="NtA_78"></a><a
  href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> is quoted as a warning example, and the
  baneful effects of authority are often depicted<a name="NtA_79"></a><a
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a>. The true philosophic spirit requires
  us to find out what can be said for every view. It is a positive duty to
  discuss all aspects of every question, after the example of the Old
  Academy and Aristotle<a name="NtA_80"></a><a
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a>. Those who demand a dogmatic statement
  of belief are mere busybodies<a name="NtA_81"></a><a
  href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a>. The Academics glory in their freedom
  of judgment. They are not compelled to defend an opinion whether they
  will or no, merely because one of their predecessors has laid it down<a
  name="NtA_82"></a><a href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a>. So far does
  Cicero carry this freedom, that in the fifth book of the <i>Tusculan
  Disputations</i>, he maintains a view entirely at variance with the whole
  of the fourth book of the <i>De Finibus</i>, and when the discrepancy is
  pointed out, refuses to be bound by his former statements, on the score
  that he is an Academic and a freeman<a name="NtA_83"></a><a
  href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a>. "Modo hoc, modo illud probabilius
  videtur<a name="NtA_84"></a><a href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>." The
  Academic sips the best of every school<a name="NtA_85"></a><a
  href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a>. He roams in the wide field of
  philosophy, while the Stoic dares not stir a foot's breadth away from
  Chrysippus<a name="NtA_86"></a><a href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a>. The
  Academic is only anxious that people should combat his opinions; for he
  makes it his sole <!-- Page xix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span> aim, with Socrates, to rid himself and
  others of the mists of error<a name="NtA_87"></a><a
  href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a>. This spirit is even found in Lucullus
  the Antiochean<a name="NtA_88"></a><a href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a>.
  While professing, however, this philosophic bohemianism, Cicero
  indignantly repels the charge that the Academy, though claiming to seek
  for the truth, has no truth to follow<a name="NtA_89"></a><a
  href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a>. The probable is for it the true.</p>

  <p>Another consideration which attracted Cicero to these tenets was their
  evident adaptability to the purposes of oratory, and the fact that
  eloquence was, as he puts it, the child of the Academy<a
  name="NtA_90"></a><a href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>. Orators,
  politicians, and stylists had ever found their best nourishment in the
  teaching of the Academic and Peripatetic masters<a name="NtA_91"></a><a
  href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a>. The Stoics and Epicureans cared
  nothing for power of expression. Again, the Academic tenets were those
  with which the common sense of the world could have most sympathy<a
  name="NtA_92"></a><a href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a>. The Academy also
  was the school which had the most respectable pedigree. Compared with its
  system, all other philosophies were plebeian<a name="NtA_93"></a><a
  href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a>. The philosopher who best preserved the
  Socratic tradition was most estimable, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, and that
  man was Carneades<a name="NtA_94"></a><a
  href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In looking at the second great problem, that of the ethical standard,
  we must never forget that it was considered by nearly all the later
  philosophers as of overwhelming importance compared with the first.
  Philosophy was emphatically defined as the art of <!-- Page xx --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span> conduct (<i>ars
  vivendi</i>). All speculative and non-ethical doctrines were merely
  estimable as supplying a basis on which this practical art could be
  reared. This is equally true of the Pyrrhonian scepticism and of the
  dogmatism of Zeno and Epicurus. Their logical and physical doctrines were
  mere outworks or ramparts within which the ordinary life of the school
  was carried on. These were useful chiefly in case of attack by the enemy;
  in time of peace ethics held the supremacy. In this fact we shall find a
  key to unlock many difficulties in Cicero's philosophical writings. I may
  instance one passage in the beginning of the <i>Academica
  Posteriora</i><a name="NtA_95"></a><a href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a>,
  which has given much trouble to editors. Cicero is there charged by Varro
  with having deserted the Old Academy for the New, and admits the charge.
  How is this to be reconciled with his own oft-repeated statements that he
  never recanted the doctrines Philo had taught him? Simply thus.
  Arcesilas, Carneades, and Philo had been too busy with their polemic
  against Zeno and his followers, maintained on logical grounds, to deal
  much with ethics. On the other hand, in the works which Cicero had
  written and published before the <i>Academica</i>, wherever he had
  touched philosophy, it had been on its ethical side. The works
  themselves, moreover, were direct imitations of early Academic and
  Peripatetic writers, who, in the rough popular view which regarded ethics
  mainly or solely, really composed a single school, denoted by the phrase
  "Vetus Academia." General readers, therefore, who considered ethical
  resemblance as of far greater moment than dialectical <!-- Page xxi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span> difference,
  would naturally look upon Cicero as a supporter of their "Vetus
  Academia," so long as he kept clear of dialectic; when he brought
  dialectic to the front, and pronounced boldly for Carneades, they would
  naturally regard him as a deserter from the Old Academy to the New. This
  view is confirmed by the fact that for many years before Cicero wrote,
  the Academic dialectic had found no eminent expositor. So much was this
  the case, that when Cicero wrote the <i>Academica</i> he was charged with
  constituting himself the champion of an exploded and discredited school<a
  name="NtA_96"></a><a href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Cicero's ethics, then, stand quite apart from his dialectic. In the
  sphere of morals he felt the danger of the principle of doubt. Even in
  the <i>De Legibus</i> when the dialogue turns on a moral question, he
  begs the New Academy, which has introduced confusion into these subjects,
  to be silent<a name="NtA_97"></a><a href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a>.
  Again, Antiochus, who in the dialectical dialogue is rejected, is in the
  <i>De Legibus</i> spoken of with considerable favour<a
  name="NtA_98"></a><a href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a>. All ethical
  systems which seemed to afford stability to moral principles had an
  attraction for Cicero. He was fascinated by the Stoics almost beyond the
  power of resistance. In respect of their ethical and religious ideas he
  calls them "great and famous philosophers<a name="NtA_99"></a><a
  href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a>," and he frequently speaks with
  something like shame of the treatment they had received at the hands of
  Arcesilas and Carneades. Once he gives expression to a fear lest they
  should be the only true philosophers <!-- Page xxii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span> after all<a
  name="NtA_100"></a><a href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a>. There was a
  kind of magnificence about the Stoic utterances on morality, more suited
  to a superhuman than a human world, which allured Cicero more than the
  barrenness of the Stoic dialectic repelled him<a name="NtA_101"></a><a
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a>. On moral questions, therefore, we
  often find him going farther in the direction of Stoicism than even his
  teacher Antiochus. One great question which divided the philosophers of
  the time was, whether happiness was capable of degrees. The Stoics
  maintained that it was not, and in a remarkable passage Cicero agrees
  with them, explicitly rejecting the position of Antiochus, that a life
  enriched by virtue, but unattended by other advantages, might be happy,
  but could not be the happiest possible<a name="NtA_102"></a><a
  href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a>. He begs the Academic and Peripatetic
  schools to cease from giving an uncertain sound (balbutire) and to allow
  that the happiness of the wise man would remain unimpaired even if he
  were thrust into the bull of Phalaris<a name="NtA_103"></a><a
  href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a>. In another place he admits the
  purely Stoic doctrine that virtue is one and indivisible<a
  name="NtA_104"></a><a href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a>. These
  opinions, however, he will not allow to be distinctively Stoic, but
  appeals to Socrates as his authority for them<a name="NtA_105"></a><a
  href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>. Zeno, who is merely an ignoble
  craftsman of words, stole them from the Old Academy. This is Cicero's
  general feeling with regard to Zeno, and there can be no doubt that he
  caught it from Antiochus who, in stealing the doctrines of Zeno, ever
  stoutly maintained that Zeno had stolen them before. Cicero, however,
  regarded chiefly the ethics of Zeno with this feeling, while Antiochus so
  <!-- Page xxiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span> regarded chiefly the dialectic. It
  is just in this that the difference between Antiochus and Cicero lies. To
  the former Zeno's dialectic was true and Socratic, while the latter
  treated it as un-Socratic, looking upon Socrates as the apostle of
  doubt<a name="NtA_106"></a><a href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a>. On the
  whole Cicero was more in accord with Stoic ethics than Antiochus. Not in
  all points, however: for while Antiochus accepted without reserve the
  Stoic paradoxes, Cicero hesitatingly followed them, although he conceded
  that they were Socratic<a name="NtA_107"></a><a
  href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a>. Again, Antiochus subscribed to the
  Stoic theory that all emotion was sinful; Cicero, who was very human in
  his joys and sorrows, refused it with horror<a name="NtA_108"></a><a
  href="#Nt_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a>. It must be admitted that on some
  points Cicero was inconsistent. In the <i>De Finibus</i> he argued that
  the difference between the Peripatetic and Stoic ethics was merely one of
  terms; in the <i>Tusculan Disputations</i> he held it to be real. The
  most Stoic in tone of all his works are the <i>Tusculan Disputations</i>
  and the <i>De Officiis</i>.</p>

  <p>With regard to physics, I may remark at the outset that a
  comparatively small importance was in Cicero's time attached to this
  branch of philosophy. Its chief importance lay in the fact that ancient
  theology was, as all natural theology must be, an appendage of physical
  science. The religious element in Cicero's nature inclined him very
  strongly to sympathize with the Stoic views about the grand universal
  operation of divine power. Piety, sanctity, and moral good, were
  impossible in any form, he thought, if the divine <!-- Page xxiv --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span> government of the
  universe were denied<a name="NtA_109"></a><a
  href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a>. It went to Cicero's heart that
  Carneades should have found it necessary to oppose the beautiful Stoic
  theology, and he defends the great sceptic by the plea that his one aim
  was to arouse men to the investigation of the truth<a
  name="NtA_110"></a><a href="#Nt_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a>. At the same
  time, while really following the Stoics in physics, Cicero often believed
  himself to be following Aristotle. This partly arose from the actual
  adoption by the late Peripatetics of many Stoic doctrines, which they
  gave out as Aristotelian. The discrepancy between the spurious and the
  genuine Aristotelian views passed undetected, owing to the strange
  oblivion into which the most important works of Aristotle had fallen<a
  name="NtA_111"></a><a href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a>. Still, Cicero
  contrives to correct many of the extravagances of the Stoic physics by a
  study of Aristotle and Plato. For a thorough understanding of his notions
  about physics, the <i>Timaeus</i> of Plato, which he knew well and
  translated, is especially important. It must not be forgotten, also, that
  the Stoic physics were in the main Aristotelian, and that Cicero was well
  aware of the fact.</p>

  <p>Very few words are necessary in order to characterize Cicero's
  estimate of the Peripatetic and Epicurean schools. The former was not
  very powerfully represented during his lifetime. The philosophical
  descendants of the author of the <i>Organon</i> were notorious for their
  ignorance of logic<a name="NtA_112"></a><a
  href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a>, and in ethics had approximated
  considerably to the Stoic teaching. While not much influenced by the
  school, Cicero generally <!-- Page xxv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span> treats it tenderly for the sake of its
  great past, deeming it a worthy branch of the true Socratic family. With
  the Epicureans the case was different. In physics they stood absolutely
  alone, their system was grossly unintellectual, and they discarded
  mathematics. Their ethical doctrines excited in Cicero nothing but
  loathing, dialectic they did not use, and they crowned all their errors
  by a sin which the orator could never pardon, for they were completely
  indifferent to every adornment and beauty of language.</p>

<p class="center">III. <i>The aim of Cicero in writing his philosophical works</i>.</p>

  <p>It is usual to charge Cicero with a want of originality as a
  philosopher, and on that score to depreciate his works. The charge is
  true, but still absurd, for it rests on a misconception, not merely of
  Cicero's purpose in writing, but of the whole spirit of the later Greek
  speculation. The conclusion drawn from the charge is also quite
  unwarranted. If the later philosophy of the Greeks is of any value,
  Cicero's works are of equal value, for it is only from them that we get
  any full or clear view of it. Any one who attempts to reconcile the
  contradictions of Stobaeus, Diogenes Laertius, Sextus Empiricus, Plutarch
  and other authorities, will perhaps feel little inclination to cry out
  against the confusion of Ciceros ideas. Such outcry, now so common, is
  due largely to the want, which I have already noticed, of any clear
  exposition of the <!-- Page xxvi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span> variations in doctrine which the late
  Greek schools exhibited during the last two centuries before the
  Christian era. But to return to the charge of want of originality. This
  is a virtue which Cicero never claims. There is scarcely one of his works
  (if we except the third book of the <i>De Officiis</i>), which he does
  not freely confess to be taken wholly from Greek sources. Indeed at the
  time when he wrote, originality would have been looked upon as a fault
  rather than an excellence. For two centuries, if we omit Carneades, no
  one had propounded anything substantially novel in philosophy: there had
  been simply one eclectic combination after another of pre-existing
  tenets. It would be hasty to conclude that the writers of these two
  centuries are therefore undeserving of our study, for the spirit, if not
  the substance of the doctrines had undergone a momentous change, which
  ultimately exercised no unimportant influence on society and on the
  Christian religion itself.</p>

  <p>When Cicero began to write, the Latin language may be said to have
  been destitute of a philosophical literature. Philosophy was a sealed
  study to those who did not know Greek. It was his aim, by putting the
  best Greek speculation into the most elegant Latin form, to extend the
  education of his countrymen, and to enrich their literature. He wished at
  the same time to strike a blow at the ascendency of Epicureanism
  throughout Italy. The doctrines of Epicurus had alone appeared in Latin
  in a shape suited to catch the popular taste. There seems to have been a
  very large Epicurean literature in Latin, of which all but a few scanty
  traces is now lost. C. Amafinius, mentioned in <!-- Page xxvii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span> the
  <i>Academica</i><a name="NtA_113"></a><a
  href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a>, was the first to write, and his
  books seem to have had an enormous circulation<a name="NtA_114"></a><a
  href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a>. He had a large number of imitators,
  who obtained such a favourable reception, that, in Cicero's strong
  language, they took possession of the whole of Italy<a
  name="NtA_115"></a><a href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a>. Rabirius and
  Catius the Insubrian, possibly the epicure and friend of Horace, were two
  of the most noted of these writers. Cicero assigns various reasons for
  their extreme popularity: the easy nature of the Epicurean physics, the
  fact that there was no other philosophy for Latin readers, and the
  voluptuous blandishments of pleasure. This last cause, as indeed he in
  one passage seems to allow, must have been of little real importance. It
  is exceedingly remarkable that the whole of the Roman Epicurean
  literature dealt in an overwhelmingly greater degree with the physics
  than with the ethics of Epicurus. The explanation is to be found in the
  fact that the Italian races had as yet a strong practical basis for
  morality in the legal and social constitution of the family, and did not
  much feel the need of any speculative system; while the general decay
  among the educated classes of a belief in the supernatural, accompanied
  as it was by an increase of superstition among the masses, prepared the
  way for the acceptance of a purely mechanical explanation of the
  universe. But of this subject, interesting and important as it is in
  itself, and neglected though it has been, I can treat no farther.</p>

  <p>These Roman Epicureans are continually reproached <!-- Page xxviii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span> by
  Cicero for their uncouth style of writing<a name="NtA_116"></a><a
  href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a>. He indeed confesses that he had not
  read them, but his estimate of them was probably correct. A curious
  question arises, which I cannot here discuss, as to the reasons Cicero
  had for omitting all mention of Lucretius when speaking of these Roman
  Epicureans. The most probable elucidation is, that he found it impossible
  to include the great poet in his sweeping condemnation, and being
  unwilling to allow that anything good could come from the school of
  Epicurus, preferred to keep silence, which nothing compelled him to
  break, since Lucretius was an obscure man and only slowly won his way to
  favour with the public.</p>

  <p>In addition to his desire to undermine Epicureanism in Italy, Cicero
  had a patriotic wish to remove from the literature of his country the
  reproach that it was completely destitute where Greek was richest. He
  often tries by the most far-fetched arguments to show that philosophy had
  left its mark on the early Italian peoples<a name="NtA_117"></a><a
  href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a>. To those who objected that
  philosophy was best left to the Greek language, he replies with
  indignation, accusing them of being untrue to their country<a
  name="NtA_118"></a><a href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a>. It would be a
  glorious thing, he thinks, if Romans were no longer absolutely compelled
  to resort to Greeks<a name="NtA_119"></a><a
  href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a>. He will not even concede that the
  Greek is a richer tongue than the Latin<a name="NtA_120"></a><a
  href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a>. As for the alleged incapacity of the
  Roman intellect to deal with philosophical <!-- Page xxix --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix"></a>[xxix]</span> enquiries, he will
  not hear of it. It is only, he says, because the energy of the nation has
  been diverted into other channels that so little progress has been made.
  The history of Roman oratory is referred to in support of this opinion<a
  name="NtA_121"></a><a href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a>. If only an
  impulse were given at Rome to the pursuit of philosophy, already on the
  wane in Greece, Cicero thought it would flourish and take the place of
  oratory, which he believed to be expiring amid the din of civil war<a
  name="NtA_122"></a><a href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt that Cicero was penetrated by the belief that he
  could thus do his country a real service. In his enforced political
  inaction, and amid the disorganisation of the law-courts, it was the one
  service he could render<a name="NtA_123"></a><a
  href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a>. He is within his right when he
  claims praise for not abandoning himself to idleness or worse, as did so
  many of the most prominent men of the time<a name="NtA_124"></a><a
  href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a>. For Cicero idleness was misery, and
  in those evil times he was spurred on to exertion by the deepest sorrow<a
  name="NtA_125"></a><a href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a>. Philosophy
  took the place of forensic oratory, public harangues, and politics<a
  name="NtA_126"></a><a href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a>. It is strange
  to find Cicero making such elaborate apologies as he does for devoting
  himself to philosophy, and a careless reader might set them down to
  egotism. But it must never be forgotten that at Rome such studies were
  merely the amusement of the wealthy; the total devotion of a life to them
  seemed well enough for Greeks, <!-- Page xxx --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xxx"></a>[xxx]</span> but for Romans unmanly, unpractical and
  unstatesmanlike<a name="NtA_127"></a><a
  href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a>. There were plenty of Romans who were
  ready to condemn such pursuits altogether, and to regard any fresh
  importation from Greece much in the spirit with which things French were
  received by English patriots immediately after the great war. Others,
  like the Neoptolemus of Ennius, thought a little learning in philosophy
  was good, but a great deal was a dangerous thing<a name="NtA_128"></a><a
  href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a>. Some few preferred that Cicero
  should write on other subjects<a name="NtA_129"></a><a
  href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a>. To these he replies by urging the
  pressing necessity there was for works on philosophy in Latin.</p>

  <p>Still, amid much depreciation, sufficient interest and sympathy were
  roused by his first philosophical works to encourage Cicero to proceed.
  The elder generation, for whose approbation he most cared, praised the
  books, and many were incited both to read and to write philosophy<a
  name="NtA_130"></a><a href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a>. Cicero now
  extended his design, which seems to have been at first indefinite, so as
  to bring within its scope every topic which Greek philosophers were
  accustomed to treat<a name="NtA_131"></a><a
  href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a>. Individual questions in philosophy
  could not be thoroughly understood till the whole subject had been
  mastered<a name="NtA_132"></a><a href="#Nt_132"><sup>[132]</sup></a>.
  This design then, which is not explicitly stated in the two earliest
  works which we possess, the <i>Academica</i> and the <i>De Finibus</i>,
  required the composition of a sort of philosophical encyclopaedia. Cicero
  never claimed to be more than an interpreter of Greek philosophy <!--
  Page xxxi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi"></a>[xxxi]</span>
  to the Romans. He never pretended to present new views of philosophy, or
  even original criticisms on its history. The only thing he proclaims to
  be his own is his style. Looked at in this, the true light, his work
  cannot be judged a failure. Those who contrive to pronounce this judgment
  must either insist upon trying the work by a standard to which it does
  not appeal, or fail to understand the Greek philosophy it copies, or
  perhaps make Cicero suffer for the supposed worthlessness of the
  philosophy of his age.</p>

  <p>In accordance with Greek precedent, Cicero claims to have his
  oratorical and political writings, all or nearly all published before the
  <i>Hortensius</i>, included in his philosophical encyclopaedia<a
  name="NtA_133"></a><a href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a>. The only two
  works strictly philosophical, even in the ancient view, which preceded
  the <i>Academica</i>, were the <i>De Consolatione</i>, founded on
  Crantor's book, <span lang="el" title="peri penthous"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;
  &#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B8;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3C2;</span>, and the
  <i>Hortensius</i>, which was introductory to philosophy, or, as it was
  then called, protreptic.</p>

  <p>For a list of the philosophical works of Cicero, and the dates of
  their composition, the student must be referred to the <i>Dict. of
  Biography</i>, Art. Cicero.</p>

<p class="center">IV. <i>History of the Academica</i>.</p>

  <p>On the death of Tullia, which happened at Tusculum in February, 45
  B.C., Cicero took refuge in the solitude of his villa at Astura, which
  was pleasantly situated on the Latin coast between Antium and <!-- Page
  xxxii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii"></a>[xxxii]</span>
  Circeii<a name="NtA_134"></a><a href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a>. Here
  he sought to soften his deep grief by incessant toil. First the book
  <i>De Consolatione</i> was written. He found the mechanic exercise of
  composition the best solace for his pain, and wrote for whole days
  together<a name="NtA_135"></a><a href="#Nt_135"><sup>[135]</sup></a>. At
  other times he would plunge at early morning into the dense woods near
  his villa, and remain there absorbed in study till nightfall<a
  name="NtA_136"></a><a href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a>. Often exertion
  failed to bring relief; yet he repelled the entreaties of Atticus that he
  would return to the forum and the senate. A grief, which books and
  solitude could scarcely enable him to endure, would crush him, he felt,
  in the busy city<a name="NtA_137"></a><a
  href="#Nt_137"><sup>[137]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It was amid such surroundings that the <i>Academica</i> was written.
  The first trace of an intention to write the treatise is found in a
  letter of Cicero to Atticus, which seems to belong to the first few weeks
  of his bereavement<a name="NtA_138"></a><a
  href="#Nt_138"><sup>[138]</sup></a>. It was his wont to depend on Atticus
  very much for historical and biographical details, and in the letter in
  question he asks for just the kind of information which would be needed
  in writing the <i>Academica</i>. The words with which he introduces his
  request imply that he had determined on some new work to which our
  <i>Academica</i> would correspond<a name="NtA_139"></a><a
  href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a>. He asks what reason brought to Rome
  the embassy which Carneades accompanied; who was at that time the leader
  of the Epicurean school; who were then the most noted <span lang="el"
  title="politikoi"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;</span>
  at Athens. The meaning of the last question is made clear by a passage in
  the <i>De Oratore</i><a name="NtA_140"></a><a
  href="#Nt_140"><sup>[140]</sup></a>, <!-- Page xxxiii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii"></a>[xxxiii]</span> where Cicero
  speaks of the combined Academic and Peripatetic schools under that name.
  It may be with reference to the progress of the <i>Academica</i> that in
  a later letter he expresses himself satisfied with the advance he has
  made in his literary undertakings<a name="NtA_141"></a><a
  href="#Nt_141"><sup>[141]</sup></a>. During the whole of the remainder of
  his sojourn at Astura he continued to be actively employed; but although
  he speaks of various other literary projects, we find no express mention
  in his letters to Atticus of the <i>Academica</i><a name="NtA_142"></a><a

  <p>In the beginning of June Cicero spent a few days at his villa near
  Antium<a name="NtA_144"></a><a href="#Nt_144"><sup>[144]</sup></a>, where
  he wrote a treatise addressed to Caesar, which he afterwards suppressed<a
  name="NtA_145"></a><a href="#Nt_145"><sup>[145]</sup></a>. From the same
  place he wrote to Atticus of his intention to proceed to Tusculum or Rome
  by way of Lanuvium about the middle of June<a name="NtA_146"></a><a
  href="#Nt_146"><sup>[146]</sup></a>. He had in the time immediately
  following Tullia's death entertained an aversion for Tusculum, where she
  died. This he felt now compelled to conquer, otherwise he must either
  abandon Tusculum altogether, or, if he returned at all, a delay of even
  ten years would make the effort no less painful<a name="NtA_147"></a><a
  href="#Nt_147"><sup>[147]</sup></a>. Before setting out for Antium Cicero
  <!-- Page xxxiv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xxxiv"></a>[xxxiv]</span> wrote to Atticus that he had
  finished while at Astura <i>duo magna</i> <span lang="el"
  title="syntagmata"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>,
  words which have given rise to much controversy<a name="NtA_148"></a><a
  href="#Nt_148"><sup>[148]</sup></a>. Many scholars, including Madvig,
  have understood that the first edition of the <i>Academica</i>, along
  with the <i>De Finibus</i>, is intended. Against this view the reasons
  adduced by Krische are convincing<a name="NtA_149"></a><a
  href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a>. It is clear from the letters to
  Atticus that the <i>De Finibus</i> was being worked out book by book long
  after the first edition of the <i>Academica</i> had been placed in the
  hands of Atticus. The <i>De Finibus</i> was indeed begun at Astura<a
  name="NtA_150"></a><a href="#Nt_150"><sup>[150]</sup></a>, but it was
  still in an unfinished state when Cicero began to revise the
  <i>Academica</i><a name="NtA_151"></a><a
  href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a>. The final arrangement of the
  characters in the <i>De Finibus</i> is announced later still<a
  name="NtA_152"></a><a href="#Nt_152"><sup>[152]</sup></a>; and even at a
  later date Cicero complains that Balbus had managed to obtain
  surreptitiously a copy of the fifth book before it was properly
  corrected, the irrepressible Caerellia having copied the whole five books
  while in that state<a name="NtA_153"></a><a
  href="#Nt_153"><sup>[153]</sup></a>. A passage in the <i>De
  Divinatione</i><a name="NtA_154"></a><a
  href="#Nt_154"><sup>[154]</sup></a> affords almost direct evidence that
  the <i>Academica</i> was published before the <i>De Finibus</i>. On all
  these grounds I hold that these two works cannot be those which Cicero
  describes as having been finished simultaneously at Astura.</p>

  <p>Another view of the <span lang="el" title="syntagmata"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>
  in question is that they are simply the two books, entitled
  <i>Catulus</i> and <i>Lucullus</i>, of the <i>Priora Academica</i>. In my
  opinion <!-- Page xxxv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xxxv"></a>[xxxv]</span> the word <span lang="el"
  title="syntagma"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;</span>, the use
  of which to denote a portion of a work Madvig suspects<a
  name="NtA_155"></a><a href="#Nt_155"><sup>[155]</sup></a>, thus obtains
  its natural meaning. Cicero uses the word <span lang="el"
  title="syntaxis"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span> of the
  whole work<a name="NtA_156"></a><a href="#Nt_156"><sup>[156]</sup></a>,
  while <span lang="el" title="syntagma"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;</span><a
  name="NtA_157"></a><a href="#Nt_157"><sup>[157]</sup></a>, and <span
  lang="el" title="syngramma"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3B3;&#x3B3;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;</span><a
  name="NtA_158"></a><a href="#Nt_158"><sup>[158]</sup></a>, designate
  definite portions or divisions of a work. I should be quite content,
  then, to refer the words of Cicero to the <i>Catulus</i> and
  <i>Lucullus</i>. Krische, however, without giving reasons, decides that
  this view is unsatisfactory, and prefers to hold that the
  <i>Hortensius</i> (or <i>de Philosophia</i>) and the <i>Priora
  Academica</i> are the compositions in question. If this conjecture is
  correct, we have in the disputed passage the only reference to the
  <i>Hortensius</i> which is to be found in the letters of Cicero. We are
  quite certain that the book was written at Astura, and published before
  the <i>Academica</i>. This would be clear from the mention in the
  <i>Academica Posteriora</i> alone<a name="NtA_159"></a><a
  href="#Nt_159"><sup>[159]</sup></a>, but the words of Cicero in the <i>De
  Finibus</i><a name="NtA_160"></a><a href="#Nt_160"><sup>[160]</sup></a>
  place it beyond all doubt, showing as they do that the <i>Hortensius</i>
  had been published a sufficiently long time before the <i>De Finibus</i>,
  to have become known to a tolerably large circle of readers. Further, in
  the <i>Tusculan Disputations</i> and the <i>De Divinatione</i><a
  name="NtA_161"></a><a href="#Nt_161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> the
  <i>Hortensius</i> and the <i>Academica</i> are mentioned together in such
  a way as to show that the former was finished and given to the world
  before the latter. Nothing therefore stands in the way of Krische's
  conjecture, except the doubt I have expressed as to the use of the word
  <span lang="el" title="syntagma"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;</span>, which
  equally affects the old view maintained by Madvig.</p>

<!-- Page xxxvi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi"></a>[xxxvi]</span>

  <p>Whatever be the truth on this point, it cannot be disputed that the
  <i>Hortensius</i> and the <i>Academica</i> must have been more closely
  connected, in style and tone, than any two works of Cicero, excepting
  perhaps the <i>Academica</i> and the <i>De Finibus</i>. The interlocutors
  in the <i>Hortensius</i> were exactly the same as in the <i>Academica
  Priora</i>, for the introduction of Balbus into some editions of the
  fragments of the <i>Hortensius</i> is an error<a name="NtA_162"></a><a
  href="#Nt_162"><sup>[162]</sup></a>. The discussion in the <i>Academica
  Priora</i> is carried on at Hortensius' villa near Bauli; in the
  <i>Hortensius</i> at the villa of Lucullus near Cumae. It is rather
  surprising that under these circumstances there should be but one direct
  reference to the <i>Hortensius</i> in the <i>Lucullus</i><a
  name="NtA_163"></a><a href="#Nt_163"><sup>[163]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>While at his Tusculan villa, soon after the middle of June, B.C. 45,
  Cicero sent Atticus the <i>Torquatus</i>, as he calls the first book of
  the <i>De Finibus</i><a name="NtA_164"></a><a
  href="#Nt_164"><sup>[164]</sup></a>. He had already sent the first
  edition of the <i>Academica</i> to Rome<a name="NtA_165"></a><a
  href="#Nt_165"><sup>[165]</sup></a>. We have a mention that new prooemia
  had been added to the <i>Catulus</i> and <i>Lucullus</i>, in which the
  public characters from whom the books took their names were extolled. In
  all probability the extant prooemium of the <i>Lucullus</i> is the one
  which was then affixed. Atticus, who visited Cicero at Tusculum, had
  doubtless pointed out the incongruity between the known attainments of
  Catulus and Lucullus, and the parts they were made to take in difficult
  philosophical discussions. It is not uncharacteristic of Cicero that his
  first plan for healing the incongruity should be a <!-- Page xxxvii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii"></a>[xxxvii]</span>
  deliberate attempt to impose upon his readers a set of statements
  concerning the ability and culture of these two noble Romans which he
  knew, and in his own letters to Atticus admitted, to be false. I may
  note, as of some interest in connection with the <i>Academica</i>, the
  fact that among the unpleasant visits received by Cicero at Tusculum was
  one from Varro<a name="NtA_166"></a><a
  href="#Nt_166"><sup>[166]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>On the 23rd July, Cicero left Home for Arpinum, in order, as he says,
  to arrange some business matters, and to avoid the embarrassing
  attentions of Brutus<a name="NtA_167"></a><a
  href="#Nt_167"><sup>[167]</sup></a>. Before leaving Astura, however, it
  had been his intention to go on to Arpinum<a name="NtA_168"></a><a
  href="#Nt_168"><sup>[168]</sup></a>. He seems to have been still
  unsatisfied with his choice of interlocutors for the <i>Academica</i>,
  for the first thing he did on his arrival was to transfer the parts of
  Catulus and Lucullus to Cato and Brutus<a name="NtA_169"></a><a
  href="#Nt_169"><sup>[169]</sup></a>. This plan was speedily cast aside on
  the receipt of a letter from Atticus, strongly urging that the whole work
  should be dedicated to Varro, or if not the <i>Academica</i>, the <i>De
  Finibus</i><a name="NtA_170"></a><a href="#Nt_170"><sup>[170]</sup></a>.
  Cicero had never been very intimate with Varro: their acquaintance seems
  to have been chiefly maintained through Atticus, who was at all times
  anxious to draw them more closely together. Nine years before he had
  pressed Cicero to find room in his works for some mention of Varro<a
  name="NtA_171"></a><a href="#Nt_171"><sup>[171]</sup></a>. The nature of
  the works on which our author was then engaged had made it difficult to
  comply with the request<a name="NtA_172"></a><a
  href="#Nt_172"><sup>[172]</sup></a>. Varro had promised on his side, full
  two years before the <i>Academica</i> was <!-- Page xxxviii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii"></a>[xxxviii]</span> written, to
  dedicate to Cicero his great work <i>De Lingua Latino</i>. In answer to
  the later entreaty of Atticus, Cicero declared himself very much
  dissatisfied with Varro's failure to fulfil his promise. From this it is
  evident that Cicero knew nothing of the scope or magnitude of that work.
  His complaint that Varro had been writing for two years without making
  any progress<a name="NtA_173"></a><a href="#Nt_173"><sup>[173]</sup></a>,
  shows that there could have been little of anything like friendship
  between the two. Apart from these causes for grumbling, Cicero thought
  the suggestion of Atticus a "godsend<a name="NtA_174"></a><a
  href="#Nt_174"><sup>[174]</sup></a>." Since the <i>De Finibus</i> was
  already "betrothed" to Brutus, he promised to transfer to Varro the
  <i>Academica</i>, allowing that Catulus and Lucullus, though of noble
  birth, had no claim to learning<a name="NtA_175"></a><a
  href="#Nt_175"><sup>[175]</sup></a>. So little of it did they possess
  that they could never even have dreamed of the doctrines they had been
  made in the first edition of the <i>Academica</i> to maintain<a
  name="NtA_176"></a><a href="#Nt_176"><sup>[176]</sup></a>. For them
  another place was to be found, and the remark was made that the
  <i>Academica</i> would just suit Varro, who was a follower of Antiochus,
  and the fittest person to expound the opinions of that philosopher<a
  name="NtA_177"></a><a href="#Nt_177"><sup>[177]</sup></a>. It happened
  that continual rain fell during the first few days of Cicero's stay at
  Arpinum, so he employed his whole time in editing once more his
  <i>Academica</i>, which he now divided into four books instead of two,
  making the interlocutors himself, Varro and Atticus<a
  name="NtA_178"></a><a href="#Nt_178"><sup>[178]</sup></a>. The position
  occupied by Atticus in the dialogue was quite an <!-- Page xxxix --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix"></a>[xxxix]</span> inferior one, but
  he was so pleased with it that Cicero determined to confer upon him often
  in the future such minor parts<a name="NtA_179"></a><a
  href="#Nt_179"><sup>[179]</sup></a>. A suggestion of Atticus that Cotta
  should also be introduced was found impracticable<a name="NtA_180"></a><a
  href="#Nt_180"><sup>[180]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Although the work of re-editing was vigorously pushed on, Cicero had
  constant doubts about the expediency of dedicating the work to Varro. He
  frequently throws the whole responsibility for the decision upon Atticus,
  but for whose importunities he would probably again have changed his
  plans. Nearly every letter written to Atticus during the progress of the
  work contains entreaties that he would consider the matter over and over
  again before he finally decided<a name="NtA_181"></a><a
  href="#Nt_181"><sup>[181]</sup></a>. As no reasons had been given for
  these solicitations, Atticus naturally grew impatient, and Cicero was
  obliged to assure him that there were reasons, which he could not
  disclose in a letter<a name="NtA_182"></a><a
  href="#Nt_182"><sup>[182]</sup></a>. The true reasons, however, did
  appear in some later letters. In one Cicero said: "I am in favour of
  Varro, and the more so because he wishes it, but you know he is</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>So there often flits before me a vision of his face, as he grumbles,
  it may be, that my part in the treatise is more liberally sustained than
  his; a charge which you will perceive to be untrue<a
  name="NtA_183"></a><a href="#Nt_183"><sup>[183]</sup></a>." Cicero, then,
  feared Varro's temper, and perhaps his knowledge and real critical
  fastidiousness. Before these explanations Atticus <!-- Page xl --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl"></a>[xl]</span> had concluded that
  Cicero was afraid of the effect the work might produce on the public.
  This notion Cicero assured him to be wrong; the only cause for his
  vacillation was his doubt as to how Varro would receive the dedication<a
  name="NtA_184"></a><a href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a>. Atticus would
  seem to have repeatedly communicated with Varro, and to have assured
  Cicero that there was no cause for fear; but the latter refused to take a
  general assurance, and anxiously asked for a detailed account of the
  reasons from which it proceeded<a name="NtA_185"></a><a
  href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a>. In order to stimulate his friend,
  Atticus affirmed that Varro was jealous of some to whom Cicero had shown
  more favour<a name="NtA_186"></a><a href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a>.
  We find Cicero eagerly asking for more information, on this point: was it
  Brutus of whom Varro was jealous? It seems strange that Cicero should not
  have entered into correspondence with Varro himself. Etiquette seems to
  have required that the recipient of a dedication should be assumed
  ignorant of the intentions of the donor till they were on the point of
  being actually carried out. Thus although Cicero saw Brutus frequently
  while at Tusculum, he apparently did not speak to him about the <i>De
  Finibus</i>, but employed Atticus to ascertain his feeling about the
  dedication<a name="NtA_187"></a><a
  href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Cicero's own judgment about the completed second edition of the
  <i>Academica</i> is often given in the letters. He tells us that it
  extended, on the whole, to greater length than the first, though much had
  been omitted; <!-- Page xli --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xli"></a>[xli]</span> he adds, "Unless human self love
  deceives me, the books have been so finished that the Greeks themselves
  have nothing in the same department of literature to approach them....
  This edition will be more brilliant, more terse, and altogether better
  than the last<a name="NtA_188"></a><a
  href="#Nt_188"><sup>[188]</sup></a>." Again: "The Antiochean portion has
  all the point of Antiochus combined with any polish my style may
  possess<a name="NtA_189"></a><a href="#Nt_189"><sup>[189]</sup></a>."
  Also: "I have finished the book with I know not what success, but with a
  care which nothing could surpass<a name="NtA_190"></a><a
  href="#Nt_190"><sup>[190]</sup></a>." The binding and adornment of the
  presentation copy for Varro received great attention, and the letter
  accompanying it was carefully elaborated<a name="NtA_191"></a><a
  href="#Nt_191"><sup>[191]</sup></a>. Yet after everything had been done
  and the book had been sent to Atticus at Rome, Cicero was still uneasy as
  to the reception it would meet with from Varro. He wrote thus to Atticus:
  "I tell you again and again that the presentation will be at your own
  risk. So if you begin to hesitate, let us desert to Brutus, who is also a
  follower of Antiochus. 0 Academy, on the wing as thou wert ever wont,
  flitting now hither, now thither!" Atticus on his part "shuddered" at the
  idea of taking the responsibility<a name="NtA_192"></a><a
  href="#Nt_192"><sup>[192]</sup></a>. After the work had passed into his
  hands, Cicero begged him to take all precautions to prevent it from
  getting into circulation until they could meet one another in Rome<a
  name="NtA_193"></a><a href="#Nt_193"><sup>[193]</sup></a>. This warning
  was necessary, because Balbus and Caerellia had just managed to get
  access to the <i>De Finibus</i><a name="NtA_194"></a><a
  href="#Nt_194"><sup>[194]</sup></a>. In a letter, dated apparently a day
  or two later, Cicero declared his intention <!-- Page xlii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii"></a>[xlii]</span> to meet Atticus at
  Rome and send the work to Varro, should it be judged advisable to do so,
  after a consultation<a name="NtA_195"></a><a
  href="#Nt_195"><sup>[195]</sup></a>. The meeting ultimately did not take
  place, but Cicero left the four books in Atticus' power, promising to
  approve any course that might be taken<a name="NtA_196"></a><a
  href="#Nt_196"><sup>[196]</sup></a>. Atticus wrote to say that as soon as
  Varro came to Rome the books would be sent to him. "By this time, then,"
  says Cicero, when he gets the letter, "you have taken the fatal step; oh
  dear! if you only knew at what peril to yourself! Perhaps my letter
  stopped you, although you had not read it when you wrote. I long to hear
  how the matter stands<a name="NtA_197"></a><a
  href="#Nt_197"><sup>[197]</sup></a>." Again, a little later: "You have
  been bold enough, then, to give Varro the books? I await his judgment
  upon them, but when will he read them?" Varro probably received the books
  in the first fortnight of August, 45 B.C., when Cicero was hard at work
  on the <i>Tusculan Disputations</i><a name="NtA_198"></a><a
  href="#Nt_198"><sup>[198]</sup></a>. A copy of the first edition had
  already got into Varro's hands, as we learn from a letter, in which
  Cicero begs Atticus to ask Varro to make some alterations in his copy of
  the <i>Academica</i>, at a time when the fate of the second edition was
  still undecided<a name="NtA_199"></a><a
  href="#Nt_199"><sup>[199]</sup></a>. From this fact we may conclude that
  Cicero had given up all hope of suppressing the first edition. If he
  consoles Atticus for the uselessness of his copies of the first edition,
  it does not contradict my supposition, for Cicero of course assumes that
  Atticus, whatever may be the feeling of other people, wishes to have the
  "Splendidiora, breviora, <!-- Page xliii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xliii"></a>[xliii]</span> meliora." Still, on every occasion
  which offered, the author sought to point out as his authorised edition
  the one in four books. He did so in a passage written immediately after
  the <i>Academica Posteriora</i> was completed<a name="NtA_200"></a><a
  href="#Nt_200"><sup>[200]</sup></a>, and often subsequently, when he most
  markedly mentioned the number of the books as four<a
  name="NtA_201"></a><a href="#Nt_201"><sup>[201]</sup></a>. That he wished
  the work to bear the title <i>Academica</i> is clear<a
  name="NtA_202"></a><a href="#Nt_202"><sup>[202]</sup></a>. The
  expressions <i>Academica quaestio</i>, <span lang="el" title="Akadêmikê syntaxis"
  >&#x391;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;
  &#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>, and
  <i>Academia</i>, are merely descriptive<a name="NtA_203"></a><a
  href="#Nt_203"><sup>[203]</sup></a>; so also is the frequent appellation
  <i>Academici libri</i><a name="NtA_204"></a><a
  href="#Nt_204"><sup>[204]</sup></a>. The title <i>Academicae
  Quaestiones</i>, found in many editions, is merely an imitation of the
  <i>Tusculanae Quaestiones</i>, which was supported by the false notion,
  found as early as Pliny<a name="NtA_205"></a><a
  href="#Nt_205"><sup>[205]</sup></a>, that Cicero had a villa called
  Academia, at which the book was written. He had indeed a Gymnasium at his
  Tusculan villa, which he called his Academia, but we are certain from the
  letters to Atticus that the work was written entirely at Astura, Antium,
  and Arpinum.</p>

  <p>Quintilian seems to have known the first edition very well<a
  name="NtA_206"></a><a href="#Nt_206"><sup>[206]</sup></a>, but the second
  edition is the one which is most frequently quoted. The four books are
  expressly referred to by Nonius, Diomedes, and Lactantius, under the
  title <i>Academica</i>. Augustine speaks of them only as <i>Academici
  libri</i>, and his references show that he knew the second edition only.
  Lactantius also uses this name occasionally, though he generally speaks
  of <!-- Page xliv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xliv"></a>[xliv]</span> the <i>Academica</i>. Plutarch shows
  only a knowledge of the first edition<a name="NtA_207"></a><a
  href="#Nt_207"><sup>[207]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>I have thought it advisable to set forth in plain terms the history of
  the genesis of the book, as gathered from Cicero's letters to Atticus.
  That it was not unnecessary to do so may be seen from the astounding
  theories which old scholars of great repute put forward concerning the
  two editions. A fair summary of them may be seen in the preface of
  Goerenz. I now proceed to examine into the constitution and arrangement
  of the two editions.</p>

<p class="center">a. <i>The lost dialogue "Catulus."</i></p>

  <p>The whole of the characters in this dialogue and the <i>Lucullus</i>
  are among those genuine Optimates and adherents of the senatorial party
  whom Cicero so loves to honour. The Catulus from whom the lost dialogue
  was named was son of the illustrious colleague of Marius. With the
  political career of father and son we shall have little to do. I merely
  inquire what was their position with respect to the philosophy of the
  time, and the nature of their connection with Cicero.</p>

  <p>Catulus the younger need not detain us long. It is clear from the
  <i>Lucullus</i><a name="NtA_208"></a><a
  href="#Nt_208"><sup>[208]</sup></a> that he did little more than put
  forward opinions he had received from his father. Cicero would,
  doubtless, have preferred to introduce the elder man as speaking for
  himself, but in that case, as in the <i>De Oratore</i>, the author would
  have been <!-- Page xlv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xlv"></a>[xlv]</span> compelled to exclude himself from the
  conversation<a name="NtA_209"></a><a href="#Nt_209"><sup>[209]</sup></a>.
  The son, therefore, is merely the mouthpiece of the father, just as
  Lucullus, in the dialogue which bears his name, does nothing but render
  literally a speech of Antiochus, which he professes to have heard<a
  name="NtA_210"></a><a href="#Nt_210"><sup>[210]</sup></a>. For the
  arrangement in the case of both a reason is to be found in their <span
  lang="el" title="atripsia"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C8;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> with respect to
  philosophy<a name="NtA_211"></a><a href="#Nt_211"><sup>[211]</sup></a>.
  This <span lang="el" title="atripsia"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C8;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> did not amount
  to <span lang="el" title="apaideusia"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>,
  or else Cicero could not have made Catulus the younger the advocate of
  philosophy in the <i>Hortensius</i><a name="NtA_212"></a><a
  href="#Nt_212"><sup>[212]</sup></a>. Though Cicero sometimes classes the
  father and son together as men of literary culture and perfect masters of
  Latin style, it is very evident on a comparison of all the passages where
  the two are mentioned, that no very high value was placed on the learning
  of the son<a name="NtA_213"></a><a href="#Nt_213"><sup>[213]</sup></a>.
  But however slight were the claims of Catulus the younger to be
  considered a philosopher, he was closely linked to Cicero by other ties.
  During all the most brilliant period of Cicero's life, Catulus was one of
  the foremost Optimates of Rome, and his character, life, and influence
  are often depicted in even extravagant language by the orator<a
  name="NtA_214"></a><a href="#Nt_214"><sup>[214]</sup></a>. He is one of
  the pillars of the state<a name="NtA_215"></a><a
  href="#Nt_215"><sup>[215]</sup></a>, Cicero cries, and deserves to be
  classed with the ancient worthies of Rome<a name="NtA_216"></a><a
  href="#Nt_216"><sup>[216]</sup></a>. When he opposes the Manilian law,
  and asks the people on whom they would rely if Pompey, with such gigantic
  power concentrated in his hands, were to die, the people answer with one
  <!-- Page xlvi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xlvi"></a>[xlvi]</span> voice "On you<a name="NtA_217"></a><a
  href="#Nt_217"><sup>[217]</sup></a>." He alone was bold enough to rebuke
  the follies, on the one hand, of the mob, on the other, of the senate<a
  name="NtA_218"></a><a href="#Nt_218"><sup>[218]</sup></a>. In him no
  storm of danger, no favouring breeze of fortune, could ever inspire
  either fear or hope, or cause to swerve from his own course<a
  name="NtA_219"></a><a href="#Nt_219"><sup>[219]</sup></a>. His influence,
  though he be dead, will ever live among his countrymen<a
  name="NtA_220"></a><a href="#Nt_220"><sup>[220]</sup></a>. He was not
  only glorious in his life, but fortunate in his death<a
  name="NtA_221"></a><a href="#Nt_221"><sup>[221]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Apart from Cicero's general agreement with Catulus in politics, there
  were special causes for his enthusiasm. Catulus was one of the <i>viri
  consulares</i> who had given their unreserved approval to the measures
  taken for the suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy, and was the
  first to confer on Cicero the greatest glory of his life, the title
  "Father of his country<a name="NtA_222"></a><a
  href="#Nt_222"><sup>[222]</sup></a>." So closely did Cicero suppose
  himself to be allied to Catulus, that a friend tried to console him for
  the death of Tullia, by bidding him remember "Catulus and the olden
  times<a name="NtA_223"></a><a href="#Nt_223"><sup>[223]</sup></a>." The
  statement of Catulus, often referred to by Cicero, that Rome had never
  been so unfortunate as to have two bad consuls in the same year, except
  when Cinna held the office, may have been intended to point a contrast
  between the zeal of Cicero and the lukewarmness of his colleague
  Antonius<a name="NtA_224"></a><a href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a>.
  Archias, who wrote in honour of Cicero's consulship, lived in the house
  of the two Catuli<a name="NtA_225"></a><a
  href="#Nt_225"><sup>[225]</sup></a>.</p>

<!-- Page xlvii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii"></a>[xlvii]</span>

  <p>We have seen that when Cicero found it too late to withdraw the first
  edition of the <i>Academica</i> from circulation, he affixed a prooemium
  to each book, Catulus being lauded in the first, Lucullus in the second.
  From the passages above quoted, and from our knowledge of Cicero's habit
  in such matters, we can have no difficulty in conjecturing at least a
  portion of the contents of the lost prooemium to the <i>Catulus</i>. The
  achievements of the elder Catulus were probably extolled, as well as
  those of his son. The philosophical knowledge of the elder man was made
  to cast its lustre on the younger. Cicero's glorious consulship was once
  more lauded, and great stress was laid upon the patronage it received
  from so famous a man as the younger Catulus, whose praises were sung in
  the fervid language which Cicero lavishes on the same theme elsewhere.
  Some allusion most likely was made to the connection of Archias with the
  Catuli, and to the poem he had written in Cicero's honour. Then the
  occasion of the dialogue, its supposed date, and the place where it was
  held, were indicated. The place was the Cuman villa of Catulus<a
  name="NtA_226"></a><a href="#Nt_226"><sup>[226]</sup></a>. The feigned
  date must fall between the year 60 B.C. in which Catulus died, and 63,
  the year of Cicero's consulship, which is alluded to in the
  <i>Lucullus</i><a name="NtA_227"></a><a
  href="#Nt_227"><sup>[227]</sup></a>. It is well known that in the
  arrangement of his dialogues Cicero took every precaution against
  anachronisms.</p>

  <p>The prooemium ended, the dialogue commenced. Allusion was undoubtedly
  made to the <i>Hortensius</i>, in which the same speakers had been
  engaged; and after more compliments had been bandied about, most of <!--
  Page xlviii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_xlviii"></a>[xlviii]</span> which would fall to Cicero's
  share, a proposal was made to discuss the great difference between the
  dogmatic and sceptic schools. Catulus offered to give his father's views,
  at the same time commending his father's knowledge of philosophy. Before
  we proceed to construct in outline the speech of Catulus from indications
  offered by the <i>Lucullus</i>, it is necessary to speak of the character
  and philosophical opinions of Catulus the elder.</p>

  <p>In the many passages where Cicero speaks of him, he seldom omits to
  mention his <i>sapientia</i>, which implies a certain knowledge of
  philosophy. He was, says Cicero, the kindest, the most upright, the
  wisest, the holiest of men<a name="NtA_228"></a><a
  href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a>. He was a man of universal merit, of
  surpassing worth, a second Laelius<a name="NtA_229"></a><a
  href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a>. It is easy to gather from the <i>De
  Oratore</i>, in which he appears as an interlocutor, a more detailed view
  of his accomplishments. Throughout the second and third books he is
  treated as the lettered man, par excellence, of the company<a
  name="NtA_230"></a><a href="#Nt_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a>. Appeal is made
  to him when any question is started which touches on Greek literature and
  philosophy. We are especially told that even with Greeks his acquaintance
  with Greek, and his style of speaking it, won admiration<a
  name="NtA_231"></a><a href="#Nt_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a>. He defends the
  Greeks from the attacks of Crassus<a name="NtA_232"></a><a
  href="#Nt_232"><sup>[232]</sup></a>. He contemptuously contrasts the
  Latin historians with the Greek<a name="NtA_233"></a><a
  href="#Nt_233"><sup>[233]</sup></a>. He depreciates the later Greek
  rhetorical teaching, while he bestows <!-- Page xlix --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix"></a>[xlix]</span> high commendation
  on the early sophists<a name="NtA_234"></a><a
  href="#Nt_234"><sup>[234]</sup></a>. The systematic rhetoric of Aristotle
  and Theophrastus is most to his mind<a name="NtA_235"></a><a
  href="#Nt_235"><sup>[235]</sup></a>. An account is given by him of the
  history of Greek speculation in Italy<a name="NtA_236"></a><a
  href="#Nt_236"><sup>[236]</sup></a>. The undefiled purity of his Latin
  style made him seem to many the only speaker of the language<a
  name="NtA_237"></a><a href="#Nt_237"><sup>[237]</sup></a>. He had written
  a history of his own deeds, in the style of Xenophon, which Cicero had
  imitated<a name="NtA_238"></a><a href="#Nt_238"><sup>[238]</sup></a>, and
  was well known as a wit and writer of epigrams<a name="NtA_239"></a><a
  href="#Nt_239"><sup>[239]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Although so much is said of his general culture, it is only from the
  <i>Academica</i> that we learn definitely his philosophical opinions. In
  the <i>De Oratore</i>, when he speaks of the visit of Carneades to Rome<a
  name="NtA_240"></a><a href="#Nt_240"><sup>[240]</sup></a>, he does not
  declare himself a follower of that philosopher, nor does Crassus, in his
  long speech about Greek philosophy, connect Catulus with any particular
  teacher. The only Greek especially mentioned as a friend of his, is the
  poet Antipater of Sidon<a name="NtA_241"></a><a
  href="#Nt_241"><sup>[241]</sup></a>. Still it might have been concluded
  that he was an adherent either of the Academic or Peripatetic Schools.
  Cicero repeatedly asserts that from no other schools can the orator
  spring, and the whole tone of the <i>De Oratore</i> shows that Catulus
  could have had no leaning towards the Stoics or Epicureans<a
  name="NtA_242"></a><a href="#Nt_242"><sup>[242]</sup></a>. The
  probability is that he had never placed himself under the instruction of
  Greek teachers for any length of time, but had rather gained his
  information <!-- Page l --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_l"></a>[l]</span> from books and especially from the writings
  of Clitomachus. If he had ever been in actual communication with any of
  the prominent Academics, Cicero would not have failed to tell us, as he
  does in the case of Antonius<a name="NtA_243"></a><a
  href="#Nt_243"><sup>[243]</sup></a>, and Crassus<a name="NtA_244"></a><a
  href="#Nt_244"><sup>[244]</sup></a>. It is scarcely possible that any
  direct intercourse between Philo and Catulus can have taken place,
  although one passage in the <i>Lucullus</i> seems to imply it<a
  name="NtA_245"></a><a href="#Nt_245"><sup>[245]</sup></a>. Still Philo
  had a brilliant reputation during the later years of Catulus, and no one
  at all conversant with Greek literature or society could fail to be well
  acquainted with his opinions<a name="NtA_246"></a><a
  href="#Nt_246"><sup>[246]</sup></a>. No follower of Carneades and
  Clitomachus, such as Catulus undoubtedly was<a name="NtA_247"></a><a
  href="#Nt_247"><sup>[247]</sup></a>, could view with indifference the
  latest development of Academic doctrine. The famous books of Philo were
  probably not known to Catulus<a name="NtA_248"></a><a
  href="#Nt_248"><sup>[248]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>I now proceed to draw out from the references in the <i>Lucullus</i>
  the chief features of the speech of Catulus the younger. It was probably
  introduced by a mention of Philo's books<a name="NtA_249"></a><a
  href="#Nt_249"><sup>[249]</sup></a>. Some considerable portion of the
  speech must have been directed against the innovations made by Philo upon
  the genuine Carneadean doctrine. These the elder Catulus had repudiated
  with great warmth, even charging Philo with wilful misrepresentation of
  the older Academics<a name="NtA_250"></a><a
  href="#Nt_250"><sup>[250]</sup></a>. The most important part of the
  speech, however, must have consisted of a defence of Carneades and
  Arcesilas against <!-- Page li --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_li"></a>[li]</span> the dogmatic schools<a
  name="NtA_251"></a><a href="#Nt_251"><sup>[251]</sup></a>. Catulus
  evidently concerned himself more with the system of the later than with
  that of the earlier sceptic. It is also exceedingly probable that he
  touched only very lightly on the negative Academic arguments, while he
  developed fully that positive teaching about the <span lang="el"
  title="pithanon"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span> which was so
  distinctive of Carneades. All the counter arguments of Lucullus which
  concern the destructive side of Academic teaching appear to be distinctly
  aimed at Cicero, who must have represented it in the discourse of the day
  before<a name="NtA_252"></a><a href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a>. On
  the other hand, those parts of Lucullus' speech which deal with the
  constructive part of Academicism<a name="NtA_253"></a><a
  href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> seem to be intended for Catulus, to
  whom the maintenance of the genuine Carneadean distinction between <span
  lang="el" title="adêla" >&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;</span> and
  <span lang="el" title="akatalêpta"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>
  would be a peculiarly congenial task. Thus the commendation bestowed by
  Lucullus on the way in which the <i>probabile</i> had been handled
  appertains to Catulus. The exposition of the sceptical criticism would
  naturally be reserved for the most brilliant and incisive orator of the
  party&mdash;Cicero himself. These conjectures have the advantage of
  establishing an intimate connection between the prooemium, the speech of
  Catulus, and the succeeding one of Hortensius. In the prooemium the
  innovations of Philo were mentioned; Catulus then showed that the only
  object aimed at by them, a satisfactory basis for <span lang="el"
  title="epistêmê"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B7;</span>, was
  already attained by the Carneadean theory of the <span lang="el"
  title="pithanon"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>; whereupon
  Hortensius showed, after the principles of Antiochus, that <!-- Page lii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii"></a>[lii]</span> such a basis
  was provided by the older philosophy, which both Carneades and Philo had
  wrongly abandoned. Thus Philo becomes the central point or pivot of the
  discussion. With this arrangement none of the indications in the
  <i>Lucullus</i> clash. Even the demand made by Hortensius upon Catulus<a
  name="NtA_254"></a><a href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> need only imply
  such a bare statement on the part of the latter of the negative
  Arcesilaean doctrines as would clear the ground for the Carneadean <span
  lang="el" title="pithanon"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>. One important
  opinion maintained by Catulus after Carneades, that the wise man would
  opine<a name="NtA_255"></a><a href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> (<span
  lang="el" title="ton sophon doxasein" >&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3BE;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>), seems
  another indication of the generally constructive character of his
  exposition. Everything points to the conclusion that this part of the
  dialogue was mainly drawn by Cicero from the writings of Clitomachus.</p>

  <p>Catulus was followed by Hortensius, who in some way spoke in favour of
  Antiochean opinions, but to what extent is uncertain<a
  name="NtA_256"></a><a href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a>. I think it
  extremely probable that he gave a résumé of the history of philosophy,
  corresponding to the speech of Varro in the beginning of the <i>Academica
  Posteriora</i>. One main reason in favour of this view is the difficulty
  of understanding to whom, if not to Hortensius, the substance of the
  speech could have been assigned in the first edition. In the <i>Academica
  Posteriora</i> it was necessary to make Varro speak first and not second
  as Hortensius did; this accounts for the disappearance in the second
  edition of the polemical argument of Hortensius<a name="NtA_257"></a><a
  href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a>, which would be appropriate only in
  the mouth of one <!-- Page liii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_liii"></a>[liii]</span> who was answering a speech already
  made. On the view I have taken, there would be little difficulty in the
  fact that Hortensius now advocates a dogmatic philosophy, though in the
  lost dialogue which bore his name he had argued against philosophy
  altogether<a name="NtA_258"></a><a href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a>,
  and denied that philosophy and wisdom were at all the same thing<a
  name="NtA_259"></a><a href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a>. Such a
  historical résumé as I have supposed Hortensius to give would be within
  the reach of any cultivated man of the time, and would only be put
  forward to show that the New Academic revolt against the supposed old
  Academico-Peripatetic school was unjustifiable. There is actual warrant
  for stating that his exposition of Antiochus was merely superficial<a
  name="NtA_260"></a><a href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a>. We are thus
  relieved from the necessity of forcing the meaning of the word
  <i>commoveris</i><a name="NtA_261"></a><a
  href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a>, from which Krische infers that the
  dialogue, entitled <i>Hortensius</i>, had ended in a conversion to
  philosophy of the orator from whom it was named. To any such conversion
  we have nowhere else any allusion.</p>

  <p>The relation in which Hortensius stood to Cicero, also his character
  and attainments, are too well known to need mention here. He seems to
  have been as nearly innocent of any acquaintance with philosophy as it
  was possible for an educated man to be. Cicero's materials for the speech
  of Hortensius were, doubtless, drawn from the published works and oral
  teaching of Antiochus.</p>

  <p>The speech of Hortensius was answered by Cicero himself. If my view of
  the preceding speech is correct, <!-- Page liv --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv"></a>[liv]</span> it follows that
  Cicero in his reply pursued the same course which he takes in his answer
  to Varro, part of which is preserved in the <i>Academica Posteriora</i><a
  name="NtA_262"></a><a href="#Nt_262"><sup>[262]</sup></a>. He justified
  the New Academy by showing that it was in essential harmony with the Old,
  and also with those ancient philosophers who preceded Plato. Lucullus,
  therefore, reproves him as a rebel in philosophy, who appeals to great
  and ancient names like a seditious tribune<a name="NtA_263"></a><a
  href="#Nt_263"><sup>[263]</sup></a>. Unfair use had been made, according
  to Lucullus, of Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Parmenides,
  Xenophanes, Plato, and Socrates<a name="NtA_264"></a><a
  href="#Nt_264"><sup>[264]</sup></a>. But Cicero did not merely give a
  historical summary. He must have dealt with the theory of <span lang="el"
  title="katalêptikê phantasia"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;
  &#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> and <span
  lang="el" title="ennoiai"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span> (which though
  really Stoic had been adopted by Antiochus), since he found it necessary
  to "manufacture" (<i>fabricari</i>) Latin terms to represent the Greek<a
  name="NtA_265"></a><a href="#Nt_265"><sup>[265]</sup></a>. He probably
  also commented on the headlong rashness with which the dogmatists gave
  their assent to the truth of phenomena. To this a retort is made by
  Lucullus<a name="NtA_266"></a><a href="#Nt_266"><sup>[266]</sup></a>.
  That Cicero's criticism of the dogmatic schools was incomplete may be
  seen by the fact that he had not had occasion to Latinize the terms <span
  lang="el" title="katalêpsis"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C8;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>

  &#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C7;&#x3B7;</span>, nearly all important terms in
  the Stoic, and to some extent in the Antiochean system, all of which
  Lucullus is obliged to translate for himself<a name="NtA_267"></a><a
  href="#Nt_267"><sup>[267]</sup></a>. The more the matter is examined the
  more clearly does it appear that the main purpose <!-- Page lv --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv"></a>[lv]</span> of Cicero in this
  speech was to justify from the history of philosophy the position of the
  New Academy, and not to advance sceptical arguments against experience,
  which were reserved for his answer to Lucullus. In his later speech, he
  expressly tells us that such sceptical paradoxes as were advanced by him
  in the first day's discourse were really out of place, and were merely
  introduced in order to disarm Lucullus, who was to speak next<a
  name="NtA_268"></a><a href="#Nt_268"><sup>[268]</sup></a>. Yet these
  arguments must have occupied some considerable space in Cicero's speech,
  although foreign to its main intention<a name="NtA_269"></a><a
  href="#Nt_269"><sup>[269]</sup></a>. He probably gave a summary
  classification of the sensations, with the reasons for refusing to assent
  to the truth of each class<a name="NtA_270"></a><a
  href="#Nt_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a>. The whole constitution and tenor of
  the elaborate speech of Cicero in the <i>Lucullus</i> proves that no
  general or minute demonstration of the impossibility of <span lang="el"
  title="epistêmê"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3BC;&#x3B7;</span> in the
  dogmatic sense had been attempted in his statement of the day before.
  Cicero's argument in the <i>Catulus</i> was allowed by Lucullus to have
  considerably damaged the cause of Antiochus<a name="NtA_271"></a><a
  href="#Nt_271"><sup>[271]</sup></a>. The three speeches of Catulus,
  Hortensius, and Cicero had gone over nearly the whole ground marked out
  for the discussion<a name="NtA_272"></a><a
  href="#Nt_272"><sup>[272]</sup></a>, but only cursorily, so that there
  was plenty of room for a more minute examination in the
  <i>Lucullus</i>.</p>

  <p>One question remains: how far did Cicero defend Philo against the
  attack of Catulus? Krische believes <!-- Page lvi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi"></a>[lvi]</span> that the argument of
  Catulus was answered point by point. In this opinion I cannot concur.
  Cicero never appears elsewhere as the defender of Philo's reactionary
  doctrines<a name="NtA_273"></a><a href="#Nt_273"><sup>[273]</sup></a>.
  The expressions of Lucullus seem to imply that this part of his teaching
  had been dismissed by all the disputants<a name="NtA_274"></a><a
  href="#Nt_274"><sup>[274]</sup></a>. It follows that when Cicero, in his
  letter of dedication to Varro, describes his own part as that of Philo
  (<i>partes mihi sumpsi Philonis</i><a name="NtA_275"></a><a
  href="#Nt_275"><sup>[275]</sup></a>), he merely attaches Philo's name to
  those general New Academic doctrines which had been so brilliantly
  supported by the pupil of Clitomachus in his earlier days. The two chief
  sources for Cicero's speech in the <i>Catulus</i> were, doubtless, Philo
  himself and Clitomachus.</p>

  <p>In that intermediate form of the <i>Academica</i>, where Cato and
  Brutus appeared in the place of Hortensius and Lucullus, there can be no
  doubt that Brutus occupied a more prominent position than Cato.
  Consequently Cato must have taken the comparatively inferior part of
  Hortensius, while Brutus took that of Lucullus. It may perhaps seem
  strange that a Stoic of the Stoics like Cato should be chosen to
  represent Antiochus, however much that philosopher may have borrowed from
  Zeno. The rôle given to Hortensius, however, was in my view such as any
  cultivated man might sustain who had not definitely committed himself to
  sceptical principles. So eminent an Antiochean as Brutus cannot have been
  reduced to the comparatively secondary position assigned to Hortensius in
  the <i>Academica Priora</i>. He would naturally occupy the <!-- Page lvii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii"></a>[lvii]</span> place
  given to Varro in the second edition<a name="NtA_276"></a><a
  href="#Nt_276"><sup>[276]</sup></a>. If this be true, Brutus would not
  speak at length in the first half of the work. Cato is not closely enough
  connected with the <i>Academica</i> to render it necessary to treat of
  him farther.</p>

<p class="center">b. <i>The "Lucullus."</i></p>

  <p>The day after the discussion narrated in the <i>Catulus</i>, during
  which Lucullus had been merely a looker-on, the whole party left the
  Cuman villa of Catulus early in the morning, and came to that of
  Hortensius at Bauli<a name="NtA_277"></a><a
  href="#Nt_277"><sup>[277]</sup></a>. In the evening, if the wind
  favoured, Lucullus was to leave for his villa at Neapolis, Cicero for his
  at Pompeii<a name="NtA_278"></a><a href="#Nt_278"><sup>[278]</sup></a>.
  Bauli was a little place on the gulf of Baiae, close to Cimmerium, round
  which so many legends lingered<a name="NtA_279"></a><a
  href="#Nt_279"><sup>[279]</sup></a>. The scenery in view was
  magnificent<a name="NtA_280"></a><a href="#Nt_280"><sup>[280]</sup></a>.
  As the party were seated in the xystus with its polished floor and lines
  of statues, the waves rippled at their feet, and the sea away to the
  horizon glistened and quivered under the bright sun, and changed colour
  under the freshening breeze. Within sight lay the Cuman shore and
  Puteoli, thirty stadia distant<a name="NtA_281"></a><a
  href="#Nt_281"><sup>[281]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Cicero strove to give vividness to the dialogue and <!-- Page lviii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii"></a>[lviii]</span> to keep
  it perfectly free from anachronisms. Diodotus is spoken of as still
  living, although when the words were written he had been dead for many
  years<a name="NtA_282"></a><a href="#Nt_282"><sup>[282]</sup></a>. The
  surprise of Hortensius, who is but a learner in philosophy, at the wisdom
  of Lucullus, is very dramatic<a name="NtA_283"></a><a
  href="#Nt_283"><sup>[283]</sup></a>. The many political and private
  troubles which were pressing upon Cicero when he wrote the work are kept
  carefully out of sight. Still we can catch here and there traces of
  thoughts and plans which were actively employing the author's mind at
  Astura. His intention to visit Tusculum has left its mark on the last
  section of the book, while in the last but one the <i>De Finibus</i>, the
  <i>De Natura Deorum</i> and other works are shadowed forth<a
  name="NtA_284"></a><a href="#Nt_284"><sup>[284]</sup></a>. In another
  passage the design of the <i>Tusculan Disputations</i>, which was carried
  out immediately after the publication of the <i>Academica</i> and <i>De
  Finibus</i>, is clearly to be seen<a name="NtA_285"></a><a
  href="#Nt_285"><sup>[285]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Hortensius and Catulus now sink to a secondary position in the
  conversation, which is resumed by Lucullus. His speech is especially
  acknowledged by Cicero to be drawn from the works of Antiochus<a
  name="NtA_286"></a><a href="#Nt_286"><sup>[286]</sup></a>. Nearly all
  that is known of the learning of Lucullus is told in Cicero's dialogue,
  and the passages already quoted from the letters. He seems at least to
  have dallied with culture, although his chief energy, as a private
  citizen, was directed to the care of his fish-ponds<a
  name="NtA_287"></a><a href="#Nt_287"><sup>[287]</sup></a>. In his train
  when he went to Sicily was the poet Archias, and during the whole of his
  residence in <!-- Page lix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_lix"></a>[lix]</span> the East he sought to attach learned men
  to his person. At Alexandria he was found in the company of Antiochus,
  Aristus, Heraclitus Tyrius, Tetrilius Rogus and the Selii, all men of
  philosophic tastes<a name="NtA_288"></a><a
  href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a>. He is several times mentioned by
  Pliny in the <i>Natural History</i> as the patron of Greek artists. Yet,
  as we have already seen, Cicero acknowledged in his letters to Atticus
  that Lucullus was no philosopher. He has to be propped up, like Catulus,
  by the authority of another person. All his arguments are explicitly
  stated to be derived from a discussion in which he had heard Antiochus
  engage. The speech of Lucullus was, as I have said, mainly a reply to
  that of Cicero in the <i>Catulus</i>. Any closer examination of its
  contents must be postponed till I come to annotate its actual text. The
  same may be said of Cicero's answer.</p>

  <p>In the intermediate form of the <i>Academica</i>, the speech of
  Lucullus was no doubt transferred to Brutus, but as he has only such a
  slight connection with the work, I do not think it necessary to do much
  more than call attention to the fact. I may, however, notice the close
  relationship in which Brutus stood to the other persons with whom we have
  had to deal. He was nephew of Cato, whose half-sister Servilia was wife
  of Lucullus<a name="NtA_289"></a><a href="#Nt_289"><sup>[289]</sup></a>.
  Cato was tutor to Lucullus' son, with Cicero for a sort of adviser: while
  Hortensius had married a divorced wife of Cato. All of them were of the
  Senatorial party, and Cato and Brutus lived to be present, with Cicero,
  during the war between Pompey <!-- Page lx --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_lx"></a>[lx]</span> and Caesar. Brutus and Cicero were both
  friends of Antiochus and Aristus, whose pupil Brutus was<a
  name="NtA_290"></a><a href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class="center">c. <i>The Second Edition.</i></p>

  <p>When Cicero dedicated the <i>Academica</i> to Varro, very slight
  alterations were necessary in the scenery and other accessories of the
  piece. Cicero had a villa close to the Cuman villa of Catulus and almost
  within sight of Hortensius' villa at Bauli<a name="NtA_291"></a><a
  href="#Nt_291"><sup>[291]</sup></a>. Varro's villa, at which the scene
  was now laid, was close to the Lucrine lake<a name="NtA_292"></a><a
  href="#Nt_292"><sup>[292]</sup></a>. With regard to the feigned date of
  the discourse, we may observe that at the very outset of the work it is
  shown to be not far distant from the actual time of composition<a
  name="NtA_293"></a><a href="#Nt_293"><sup>[293]</sup></a>. Many allusions
  are made to recent events, such as the utter overthrow of the Pompeian
  party, the death of Tullia<a name="NtA_294"></a><a
  href="#Nt_294"><sup>[294]</sup></a>, and the publication of the
  <i>Hortensius</i><a name="NtA_295"></a><a
  href="#Nt_295"><sup>[295]</sup></a>. Between the date of Tullia's death
  and the writing of the <i>Academica</i>, it can be shown that Varro,
  Cicero and Atticus could not have met together at Cumae. Cicero therefore
  for once admits into his works an impossibility in fact. This
  impossibility would at once occur to Varro, and Cicero anticipates his
  wonder in the letter of dedication<a name="NtA_296"></a><a
  href="#Nt_296"><sup>[296]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>For the main facts of Varro's life the student must be referred to the
  ordinary sources of information. A short account of the points of contact
  between his life and that of Cicero, with a few words about his
  philosophical <!-- Page lxi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_lxi"></a>[lxi]</span> opinions, are alone needed here. The
  first mention we have of Varro in any of Cicero's writings is in itself
  sufficient to show his character and the impossibility of anything like
  friendship between the two. Varro had done the orator some service in the
  trying time which came before the exile. In writing to Atticus Cicero had
  eulogised Varro; and in the letter to which I refer he begs Atticus to
  send Varro the eulogy to read, adding "<i>Mirabiliter moratus est, sicut
  nosti,</i> <span lang="el" title="elikta kai ouden"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3B1; &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;
  &#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;</span><a name="NtA_297"></a><a
  href="#Nt_297"><sup>[297]</sup></a>." All the references to Varro in the
  letters to Atticus are in the same strain. Cicero had to be pressed to
  write Varro a letter of thanks for supposed exertions in his behalf,
  during his exile<a name="NtA_298"></a><a
  href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a>. Several passages show that Cicero
  refused to believe in Varro's zeal, as reported by Atticus<a
  name="NtA_299"></a><a href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a>. On Cicero's
  return from exile, he and Varro remained in the same semi-friendly state.
  About the year 54 B.C., as we have already seen, Atticus in vain urged
  his friend to dedicate some work to the great polymath. After the fall of
  the Pompeian cause, Cicero and Varro do seem to have been drawn a little
  closer together. Eight letters, written mostly in the year before the
  <i>Academica</i> was published, testify to this approximation<a
  name="NtA_300"></a><a href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a>. Still they are
  all cold, forced and artificial; very different from the letters Cicero
  addressed to his real intimates, such for instance as Sulpicius, Caelius,
  Paetus, Plancus, and Trebatius. They all show a fear of giving offence to
  the harsh temper of Varro, and a humility in presence of his vast
  learning which is by <!-- Page lxii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_lxii"></a>[lxii]</span> no means natural to Cicero. The
  negotiations between Atticus and Cicero with respect to the dedication of
  the second edition, as detailed already, show sufficiently that this
  slight increase in cordiality did not lead to friendship<a
  name="NtA_301"></a><a href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The philosophical views of Varro can be gathered with tolerable
  accuracy from Augustine, who quotes considerably from, the work of Varro
  <i>De Philosophia</i><a name="NtA_302"></a><a
  href="#Nt_302"><sup>[302]</sup></a>. Beyond doubt he was a follower of
  Antiochus and the so-called Old Academy. How he selected this school
  from, among the 288 philosophies which he considered possible, by an
  elaborate and pedantic process of exhaustion, may be read by the curious
  in Augustine. My notes on the <i>Academica Posteriora</i> will show that
  there is no reason for accusing Cicero of having mistaken Varro's
  philosophical views. This supposition owes its currency to Müller, who,
  from Stoic phrases in the <i>De Lingua Latina</i>, concluded that Varro
  had passed over to the Stoics before that work was written. All that was
  Stoic in Varro came from Antiochus<a name="NtA_303"></a><a
  href="#Nt_303"><sup>[303]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The exact specification of the changes in the arrangement of the
  subject-matter, necessitated by the dedication to Varro, will be more
  conveniently deferred till we come to the fragments of the second edition
  preserved by Nonius and others. Roughly speaking, the following were the
  contents of the four books. Book I.: the historico-philosophical
  exposition of Antiochus' views, formerly given by Hortensius, now by
  Varro; then the historical justification of the Philonian position, <!--
  Page lxiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="Page_lxiii"></a>[lxiii]</span> which Cicero had given in the first
  edition as an answer to Hortensius<a name="NtA_304"></a><a
  href="#Nt_304"><sup>[304]</sup></a>. Book II.: an exposition by Cicero of
  Carneades' positive teaching, practically the same as that given by
  Catulus in ed. I.; to this was appended, probably, that foretaste of the
  negative arguments against dogmatism, which in ed. 1. had formed part of
  the answer made by Cicero to Hortensius. Book III.: a speech of Varro in
  reply to Cicero, closely corresponding to that of Lucullus in ed. 1. Book
  IV.: Cicero's answer, substantially the same as in ed. 1. Atticus must
  have been almost a <span lang="el" title="kôphon prosôpon"

  <p>I may here notice a fact which might puzzle the student. In some old
  editions the <i>Lucullus</i> is marked throughout as <i>Academicorum
  liber IV</i>. This is an entire mistake, which arose from a wrong view of
  Nonius' quotations, which are always from the <i>second</i> edition, and
  can tell us nothing about the constitution of the <i>first</i>. One other
  thing is worth remark. Halm (as many before him had done) places the
  <i>Academica Priora</i> before the <i>Posteriora</i>. This seems to me an
  unnatural arrangement; the subject-matter of the <i>Varro</i> is
  certainly prior, logically, to that of the <i>Lucullus</i>.</p>

  <p>I. <a name="BkI_1"></a><a href="#BkIN_1">1</a>. In Cumano nuper cum
  mecum Atticus noster esset, nuntiatum est nobis a M. Varrone, venisse eum
  Roma pridie vesperi et, nisi de via fessus esset, continuo ad nos
  venturum fuisse. Quod cum audissemus, nullam moram interponendam
  putavimus quin videremus hominem nobiscum et studiis isdem et vetustate
  amicitiae coniunctum. Itaque confestim ad eum ire perreximus, paulumque
  cum <i>ab</i> eius villa abessemus, ipsum ad nos venientem vidimus: atque
  ilium complexi, ut mos amicorum est, satis eum longo intervallo ad suam
  villam reduximus. <a name="BkI_2"></a><a href="#BkIN_2">2</a>. Hic pauca
  primo, atque ea percontantibus nobis, ecquid forte Roma novi, Atticus:
  Omitte ista, quae nec percontari nec audire sine molestia possumus,
  quaeso, inquit, et quaere potius ecquid ipse novi. Silent enim diutius
  Musae Varronis quam solebant, nec tamen istum cessare, sed celare quae
  scribat existimo. Minime vero, inquit ille: intemperantis enim arbitror
  esse scribere quod occultari velit: sed habeo opus magnum in manibus,
  idque iam pridem: ad hunc enim ipsum&mdash;me autem dicebat&mdash;quaedam
  institui, quae et sunt magna sane et limantur a me politius. <a
  name="BkI_3"></a><a href="#BkIN_3">3</a>. Et ego: Ista quidem, inquam,
  Varro, iam diu exspectans, non audeo tamen flagitare: audivi enim e
  Libone nostro, cuius nosti studium&mdash;nihil enim eius modi celare
  possumus&mdash;non te ea intermittere, sed accuratius tractare nec de
  manibus umquam deponere. Illud autem mihi ante hoc tempus numquam in
  mentem venit a te requirere: sed nunc, postea quam sum ingressus res eas,
  quas tecum simul didici, mandare monumentis philosophiamque veterem illam
  a Socrate ortam Latinis litteris illustrare, quaero quid sit cur, cum
  multa scribas, genus hoc praetermittas, praesertim cum et ipse in eo
  excellas et id studium totaque ea res longe ceteris et studiis et artibus
  antecedat.</p>

  <p>II. <a name="BkI_4"></a><a href="#BkIN_4">4</a>. Tum ille: Rem a me
  saepe deliberatam et multum agitatam requiris. Itaque non haesitans
  respondebo, sed ea dicam, quae mihi sunt in promptu, quod ista ipsa de re
  multum, ut dixi, et diu cogitavi. Nam cum philosophiam viderem
  diligentissime Graecis litteris explicatam, existimavi, si qui de nostris
  eius studio tenerentur, si essent Graecis doctrinis eruditi, Graeca
  potius quam nostra lecturos: sin a Graecorum artibus et disciplinis
  abhorrerent, ne haec quidem curaturos, quae sine eruditione Graeca
  intellegi non possunt: itaque ea nolui scribere, quae nec indocti
  intellegere possent nec docti legere curarent. <a name="BkI_5"></a><a
  href="#BkIN_5">5</a>. Vides autem&mdash;eadem enim ipse
  didicisti&mdash;non posse nos Amafinii aut Rabirii similis esse, qui
  nulla arte adhibita de rebus ante oculos positis volgari sermone
  disputant, nihil definiunt, nihil partiuntur, nihil apta interrogatione
  concludunt, nullam denique artem esse nec dicendi nec disserendi putant.
  Nos autem praeceptis dialecticorum et oratorum etiam, quoniam utramque
  vim virtutem esse nostri putant, sic parentes, ut legibus, verbis quoque
  novis cogimur uti, quae docti, ut dixi, a Graecis petere malent, indocti
  ne a nobis quidem accipient, ut frustra omnis suscipiatur <i>labor</i>.
  <a name="BkI_6"></a><a href="#BkIN_6">6</a>. Iam vero physica, si
  Epicurum, id est, si Democritum probarem, possem scribere ita plane, ut
  Amafinius. Quid est enim magnum, cum causas rerum efficientium
  sustuleris, de corpusculorum&mdash;ita enim appellat
  atomos&mdash;concursione fortuita loqui? Nostra tu physica nosti, quae
  cum contineantur ex effectione et ex materia ea, quam fingit et format
  effectio, adhibenda etiam geometria est, quam quibusnam quisquam
  enuntiare verbis aut quem ad intellegendum poterit adducere? <i>Quid</i>,
  haec ipsa de vita et moribus, et de expetendis fugiendisque rebus? Illi
  enim simpliciter pecudis et hominis idem bonum esse censent: apud nostros
  autem non ignoras quae sit et quanta subtilitas. <a name="BkI_7"></a><a
  href="#BkIN_7">7</a>. Sive enim Zenonem sequare, magnum est efficere ut
  quis intelligat quid sit illud verum et simplex bonum, quod non possit ab
  honestate seiungi: quod bonum quale sit negat omnino Epicurus sine
  voluptatibus sensum moventibus ne suspicari <i>quidem</i>. Si vero
  Academiam veterem persequamur, quam nos, ut scis, probamus, quam erit
  illa acute explicanda nobis! quam argute, quam obscure etiam contra
  Stoicos disserendum! Totum igitur illud philosophiae studium mihi quidem
  ipse sumo et ad vitae constantiam quantum possum et ad delectationem
  animi, nec ullum arbitror, ut apud Platonem est, maius aut melius a dis
  datum munus homini. <a name="BkI_8"></a><a href="#BkIN_8">8</a>. Sed meos
  amicos, in quibus est studium, in Graeciam mitto, id est, ad Graecos ire
  iubeo, ut ea a fontibus potius hauriant quam rivulos consectentur. Quae
  autem nemo adhuc docuerat nec erat unde studiosi scire possent, ea,
  quantum potui&mdash;nihil enim magno opere meorum miror&mdash;feci ut
  essent nota nostris. A Graecis enim peti non poterant ac post L. Aelii
  nostri occasum ne a Latinis quidem. Et tamen in illis veteribus nostris,
  quae Menippum imitati, non interpretati, quadam hilaritate conspersimus,
  multa admixta ex intima philosophia, multa dicta dialectice &#x2020;quae
  quo facilius minus docti intelligerent, iucunditate quadam ad legendum
  invitati, in laudationibus, in his ipsis antiquitatum prooemiis
  &#x2020;philosophe scribere voluimus, si modo consecuti sumus.</p>

  <p>III. <a name="BkI_9"></a><a href="#BkIN_9">9</a>. Tum, ego. Sunt,
  inquam, ista, Varro. Nam nos in nostra urbe peregrinantis errantisque
  tamquam hospites tui libri quasi domum deduxerunt, ut possemus aliquando
  qui et ubi essemus agnoscere. Tu aetatem patriae, tu descriptiones
  temporum, tu sacrorum iura, tu sacerdotum, tu domesticam, tu bellicam
  disciplinam, tu sedem regionum locorum, tu omnium divinarum humanarumque
  rerum nomina, genera, officia, causas aperuisti, plurimumque poetis
  nostris omninoque Latinis et litteris luminis et verbis attulisti, atque
  ipse varium et elegans omni fere numero poema fecisti philosophiamque
  multis locis incohasti, ad impellendum satis, ad edocendum parum. <a
  name="BkI_10"></a><a href="#BkIN_10">10</a>. Causam autem probabilem tu
  quidem adfers; aut enim Graeca legere malent qui erunt eruditi aut ne
  haec quidem qui illa nesciunt. Sed da mihi nunc: satisne probas? Immo
  vero et haec qui illa non poterunt et qui Graeca poterunt non contemnent
  sua. Quid enim causae est cur poetas Latinos Graecis litteris eruditi
  legant, philosophos non legant? an quia delectat Ennius, Pacuvius,
  Attius, multi alii, qui non verba, sed vim Graecorum expresserunt
  poetarum? Quanto magis philosophi delectabunt, si, ut illi Aeschylum,
  Sophoclem, Euripidem, sic hi Platonem imitentur, Aristotelem,
  Theophrastum? Oratores quidem laudari video, si qui e nostris Hyperidem
  sint aut Demosthenem imitati. <a name="BkI_11"></a><a
  href="#BkIN_11">11</a>. Ego autem&mdash;dicam enim, ut res est&mdash;dum
  me ambitio, dum honores, dum causae, dum rei publicae non solum cura, sed
  quaedam etiam procuratio multis officiis implicatum et constrictum
  tenebat, haec inclusa habebam et, ne obsolescerent, renovabam, cum
  licebat, legendo. Nunc vero et fortunae gravissimo percussus volnere et
  administratione rei publicae liberatus, doloris medicinam a philosophia
  peto et otii oblectationem hanc honestissimam iudico. Aut enim huic
  aetati hoc maxime aptum est aut iis rebus, si quas dignas laude gessimus,
  hoc in primis consentaneum aut etiam ad nostros civis erudiendos nihil
  utilius aut, si haec ita non sunt, nihil aliud video quod agere possimus.
  <a name="BkI_12"></a><a href="#BkIN_12">12</a>. Brutus quidem noster,
  excellens omni genere laudis, sic philosophiam Latinis litteris
  persequitur, nihil ut iisdem de rebus Graecia desideret, et eandem quidem
  sententiam sequitur quam tu. Nam Aristum Athenis audivit aliquam diu,
  cuius tu fratrem Antiochum. Quam ob rem da, quaeso, te huic etiam generi
  litterarum.</p>

  <p>IV. <a name="BkI_13"></a><a href="#BkIN_13">13</a>. Tum, ille. Istuc
  quidem considerabo, nec vero sine te. Sed de te ipso quid est, inquit,
  quod audio? Quanam, inquam, de re? Relictam a te veterem illam, inquit,
  tractari autem novam. Quid? ergo, inquam, Antiocho id magis licuerit,
  nostro familiari, remigrare in domum veterem e nova quam nobis in novam e
  vetere? certe enim recentissima quaeque sunt correcta et emendata maxime.
  Quamquam Antiochi magister Philo, magnus vir, ut tu existimas ipse, negat
  in libris, quod coram etiam ex ipso audiebamus, duas Academias esse
  erroremque eorum, qui ita putarunt, coarguit. Est, inquit, ut dicis: sed
  ignorare te non arbitror, quae contra <i>ea</i> Philonis Antiochus
  scripserit. <a name="BkI_14"></a><a href="#BkIN_14">14</a>. Immo vero et
  ista et totam veterem Academiam, a qua absum iam diu, renovari a te, nisi
  molestum est, velim, et simul, adsidamus, inquam, si videtur. Sane istud
  quidem, inquit: sum enim admodum infirmus. Sed videamus idemne Attico
  placeat fieri a me, quod te velle video. Mihi vero, ille: quid est enim
  quod malim quam ex Antiocho iam pridem audita recordari? et simul videre
  satisne ea commode dici possit Latine? Quae cum essent dicta, in
  conspectu consedimus [omnes].</p>

  <p><a name="BkI_15"></a><a href="#BkIN_15">15</a>. Tum Varro ita exorsus
  est: Socrates mihi videtur, id quod constat inter omnis, primus a rebus
  occultis et ab ipsa natura involutis, in quibus omnes ante eum philosophi
  occupati fuerunt, avocavisse philosophiam et ad vitam communem adduxisse,
  ut de virtutibus et vitiis omninoque de bonis rebus et malis quaereret,
  caelestia autem vel procul esse a nostra cognitione censeret vel, si
  maxime cognita essent, nihil tamen ad bene vivendum <i>valere</i>. <a
  name="BkI_16"></a><a href="#BkIN_16">16</a>. Hic in omnibus fere
  sermonibus, qui ab iis qui illum audierunt perscripti varie <i>et</i>
  copiose sunt, ita disputat ut nihil adfirmet ipse, refellat alios: nihil
  se scire dicat nisi id ipsum, eoque praestare ceteris, quod illi quae
  nesciant scire se putent, ipse se nihil scire, id unum sciat, ob eamque
  rem se arbitrari ab Apolline omnium sapientissimum esse dictum, quod haec
  esset una omnis sapientia non arbitrari sese scire quod nesciat. Quae cum
  diceret constanter et in ea sententia permaneret, omnis eius oratio tamen
  in virtute laudanda et in hominibus ad virtutis studium cohortandis
  consumebatur, ut e Socraticorum libris, maximeque Platonis, intellegi
  potest. <a name="BkI_17"></a><a href="#BkIN_17">17</a>. Platonis autem
  auctoritate, qui varius et multiplex et copiosus fuit, una et consentiens
  duobus vocabulis philosophiae forma instituta est, Academicorum et
  Peripateticorum: qui rebus congruentes nominibus differebant. Nam cum
  Speusippum, sororis filium, Plato philosophiae quasi heredem reliquisset,
  duos autem praestantissimo studio atque doctrina, Xenocratem Chalcedonium
  et Aristotelem Stagiritem, qui erant cum Aristotele, Peripatetici dicti
  sunt, quia disputabant inambulantes in Lycio, illi autem, qui Platonis
  instituto in Academia, quod est alterum gymnasium, coetus erant et
  sermones habere soliti, e loci vocabulo nomen habuerunt. Sed utrique
  Platonis ubertate completi certam quandam disciplinae formulam
  composuerunt et eam quidem plenam ac refertam, illam autem Socraticam
  dubitationem de omnibus rebus et nulla adfirmatione adhibita
  consuetudinem disserendi reliquerunt. Ita facta est, quod minime Socrates
  probabat, ars quaedam philosophiae et rerum ordo et descriptio
  disciplinae. <a name="BkI_18"></a><a href="#BkIN_18">18</a>. Quae quidem
  erat primo duobus, ut dixi, nominibus una: nihil enim inter Peripateticos
  et illam veterem Academiam differebat. Abundantia quadam ingeni
  praestabat, ut mihi quidem videtur, Aristoteles, sed idem fons erat
  utrisque et eadem rerum expetendarum fugiendarumque partitio.</p>

  <p>V. Sed quid ago? inquit, aut sumne sanus, qui haec vos doceo? nam etsi
  non sus Minervam, ut aiunt, tamen inepte quisquis Minervam docet. Tum
  Atticus: Tu vero, inquit, perge, Varro: valde enim amo nostra atque
  nostros, meque ista delectant, cum Latine dicuntur, et isto modo. Quid
  me, inquam, putas, qui philosophiam iam professus sim populo nostro
  exhibiturum? Pergamus igitur, inquit, quoniam placet. <a
  name="BkI_19"></a><a href="#BkIN_19">19</a>. Fuit ergo iam accepta a
  Platone philosophandi ratio triplex: una de vita et moribus, altera de
  natura et rebus occultis, tertia de disserendo et quid verum sit, quid
  falsum, quid rectum in oratione pravumve, quid consentiens, quid
  repugnans iudicando. Ac primum partem illam bene vivendi a natura
  petebant eique parendum esse dicebant, neque ulla alia in re nisi in
  natura quaerendum esse illud summum bonum quo omnia referrentur,
  constituebantque extremum esse rerum expetendarum et finem bonorum
  adeptum esse omnia e natura et animo et corpore et vita. Corporis autem
  alia ponebant esse in toto, alia in partibus: valetudinem, viris
  pulchritudinem in toto, in partibus autem sensus integros et praestantiam
  aliquam partium singularum, ut in pedibus celeritatem, vim in manibus,
  claritatem in voce, in lingua etiam explanatam vocum impressionem: <a
  name="BkI_20"></a><a href="#BkIN_20">20</a>. animi autem, quae essent ad
  comprehendendam ingeniis virtutem idonea, eaque ab iis in naturam et
  mores dividebantur. Naturae celeritatem ad discendum et memoriam dabant:
  quorum utrumque mentis esset proprium et ingeni. Morum autem putabant
  studia esse et quasi consuetudinem: quam partim exercitationis
  adsiduitate, partim ratione formabant, in quibus erat philosophia ipsa.
  In qua quod incohatum est neque absolutum, progressio quaedam ad virtutem
  appellatur: quod autem absolutum, id est virtus, quasi perfectio naturae
  omniumque rerum, quas in animis ponunt, una res optima. Ergo haec
  animorum. <a name="BkI_21"></a><a href="#BkIN_21">21</a>. Vitae
  autem&mdash;id enim erat tertium&mdash;adiuncta esse dicebant, quae ad
  virtutis usum valerent. Nam virtus animi bonis et corporis cernitur, et
  <i>in</i> quibusdam quae non tam naturae quam beatae vitae adiuncta sunt.
  Hominem esse censebant quasi partem quandam civitatis et universi generis
  humani, eumque esse coniunctum cum hominibus humana quadam societate. Ac
  de summo quidem atque naturali bono sic agunt: cetera autem pertinere ad
  id putant aut adaugendum aut tuendum, ut divitias, ut opes, ut gloriam,
  ut gratiam. Ita tripartita ab iis inducitur ratio bonorum.</p>

  <p>VI. <a name="BkI_22"></a><a href="#BkIN_22">22</a>. Atque haec illa
  sunt tria genera, quae putant plerique Peripateticos dicere. Id quidem
  non falso: est enim haec partitio illorum: illud imprudenter, si alios
  esse Academicos, qui tum appellarentur, alios Peripateticos arbitrantur.
  Communis haec ratio et utrisque hic bonorum finis videbatur, adipisci
  quae essent prima natura quaeque ipsa per sese expetenda, aut omnia aut
  maxima. Ea sunt autem maxima, quae in ipso animo atque in ipsa virtute
  versantur. Itaque omnis illa antiqua philosophia sensit in una virtute
  esse positam beatam vitam, nec tamen beatissimam, nisi adiungerentur et
  corporis et cetera, quae supra dicta sunt, ad virtutis usum idonea. <a
  name="BkI_23"></a><a href="#BkIN_23">23</a>. Ex hac descriptione agendi
  quoque aliquid in vita et officii ipsius initium reperiebatur: quod erat
  in conservatione earum rerum, quas natura praescriberet. Hinc gignebatur
  fuga desidiae voluptatumque contemptio: ex quo laborum dolorumque
  susceptio multorum magnorumque recti honestique causa et earum rerum,
  quae erant congruentes cum descriptione naturae, unde et amicitia
  exsistebat et iustitia atque aequitas: eaeque voluptatibus et multis
  vitae commodis anteponebantur. Haec quidem fuit apud eos morum institutio
  et eius partis, quam primam posui, forma atque descriptio.</p>

  <p><a name="BkI_24"></a><a href="#BkIN_24">24</a>. De natura
  autem&mdash;id enim sequebatur&mdash;ita dicebant, ut eam dividerent in
  res duas, ut altera esset efficiens, altera autem quasi huic se praebens,
  ea quae efficeretur aliquid. In eo, quod efficeret, vim esse censebant,
  in eo autem, quod efficeretur, materiam quandam: in utroque tamen
  utrumque: neque enim materiam ipsam cohaerere potuisse, si nulla vi
  contineretur, neque vim sine aliqua materia. Nihil est enim quod non
  alicubi esse cogatur. Sed quod ex utroque, id iam corpus et quasi
  qualitatem quandam nominabant: dabitis enim profecto, ut in rebus
  inusitatis, quod Graeci ipsi faciunt, a quibus haec iam diu tractantur,
  utamur verbis interdum inauditis.</p>

  <p>VII. <a name="BkI_25"></a><a href="#BkIN_25">25</a>. Nos vero, inquit
  Atticus: quin etiam Graecis licebit utare, cum voles, si te Latina forte
  deficient. Bene sane facis: sed enitar ut Latine loquar, nisi in huiusce
  modi verbis, ut philosophiam aut rhetoricam aut physicam aut dialecticam
  appellem, quibus, ut aliis multis, consuetudo iam utitur pro Latinis.
  Qualitates igitur appellavi, quas <span lang="el" title="poiotêtas"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>
  Graeci vocant, quod ipsum apud Graecos non est vulgi verbum, sed
  philosophorum, atque id in multis. Dialecticorum vero verba nulla sunt
  publica: suis utuntur. Et id quidem commune omnium fere est artium. Aut
  enim nova sunt rerum novarum facienda nomina aut ex aliis transferenda.
  Quod si Graeci faciunt, qui in his rebus tot iam saecula versantur,
  quanto id magis nobis concedendum est, qui haec nunc primum tractare
  conamur? <a name="BkI_26"></a><a href="#BkIN_26">26</a>. Tu vero, inquam,
  Varro, bene etiam meriturus mihi videris de tuis civibus, si eos non modo
  copia rerum auxeris, uti fecisti, sed etiam verborum. Audebimus ergo,
  inquit, novis verbis uti te auctore, si necesse erit. Earum igitur
  qualitatum sunt aliae principes, aliae ex his ortae. Principes sunt unius
  modi et simplices: ex his autem ortae variae sunt et quasi multiformes.
  Itaque aër&mdash;utimur enim pro Latino&mdash;et ignis et aqua et terra
  prima sunt: ex his autem ortae animantium formae earumque rerum, quae
  gignuntur e terra. Ergo illa initia et, ut e Graeco vertam, elementa
  dicuntur: e quibus aër et ignis movendi vim habent et efficiendi,
  reliquae partes accipiendi et quasi patiendi, aquam dico et terram.
  Quintum genus, e quo essent astra mentesque, singulare eorumque quattuor,
  quae supra dixi, dissimile Aristoteles quoddam esse rebatur. <a
  name="BkI_27"></a><a href="#BkIN_27">27</a>. Sed subiectam putant omnibus
  sine ulla specie atque carentem omni illa qualitate&mdash;faciamus enim
  tractando usitatius hoc verbum et tritius&mdash;materiam quandam, ex qua
  omnia expressa atque efficta sint: quae tota omnia accipere possit
  omnibusque modis mutari atque ex omni parte, eoque etiam interire non in
  nihilum, sed in suas partis, quae infinite secari ac dividi possint, cum
  sit nihil omnino in rerum natura minimum quod dividi nequeat: quae autem
  moveantur, omnia intervallis moveri, quae intervalla item infinite dividi
  possint. <a name="BkI_28"></a><a href="#BkIN_28">28</a>. Et cum ita
  moveatur illa vis, quam qualitatem esse diximus, et cum sic ultro
  citroque versetur, materiam ipsam totam penitus commutari putant et illa
  effici, quae appellant qualia, e quibus in omni natura cohaerente et
  continuata cum omnibus suis partibus effectum esse mundum, extra quem
  nulla pars materiae sit nullumque corpus, partis autem esse mundi omnia,
  quae insint in eo, quae natura sentiente teneantur, in qua ratio perfecta
  insit, quae sit eadem sempiterna: nihil enim valentius esse a quo
  intereat: <a name="BkI_29"></a><a href="#BkIN_29">29</a>. quam vim animum
  esse dicunt mundi eandemque esse mentem sapientiamque perfectam, quem
  deum appellant, omniumque rerum, quae sunt ei subiectae, quasi prudentiam
  quandam, procurantem caelestia maxime, deinde in terris ea, quae
  pertinent ad homines: quam interdum eandem necessitatem appellant, quia
  nihil aliter possit atque ab ea constitutum sit, inter quasi fatalem et
  immutabilem continuationem ordinis sempiterni: non numquam eandem
  fortunam, quod efficiat multa improvisa ac necopinata nobis propter
  obscuritatem ignorationemque causarum.</p>

  <p>VIII. <a name="BkI_30"></a><a href="#BkIN_30">30</a>. Tertia deinde
  philosophiae pars, quae erat in ratione et in disserendo, sic tractabatur
  ab utrisque. Quamquam oriretur a sensibus, tamen non esse iudicium
  veritatis in sensibus. Mentem volebant rerum esse iudicem: solam
  censebant idoneam cui crederetur, quia sola cerneret id, quod semper
  esset simplex et unius modi et tale quale esset. Hanc illi <span
  lang="el" title="idean" >&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</span>
  appellabant, iam a Platone ita nominatam, nos recte speciem possumus
  dicere. <a name="BkI_31"></a><a href="#BkIN_31">31</a>. Sensus autem
  omnis hebetes et tardos esse arbitrabantur, nec percipere ullo modo res
  eas, quae subiectae sensibus viderentur, quae essent aut ita parvae, ut
  sub sensum cadere non possent, aut ita mobiles et concitatae, ut nihil
  umquam unum esset constans, ne idem quidem, quia continenter laberentur
  et fluerent omnia. Itaque hanc omnem partem rerum opinabilem appellabant.
  <a name="BkI_32"></a><a href="#BkIN_32">32</a>. Scientiam autem nusquam
  esse censebant nisi in animi notionibus atque rationibus: qua de causa
  definitiones rerum probabant, et has ad omnia, de quibus disceptabatur,
  adhibebant. Verborum etiam explicatio probabatur, id est, qua de causa
  quaeque essent ita nominata, quam <span lang="el" title="etymologian"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</span>
  appellabant: post argumentis et quasi rerum notis ducibus utebantur ad
  probandum et ad concludendum id, quod explanari volebant: itaque
  tradebatur omnis dialecticae disciplina, id est, orationis ratione
  conclusae. Huic quasi ex altera parte oratoria vis dicendi adhibebatur,
  explicatrix orationis perpetuae ad persuadendum accommodatae. <a
  name="BkI_33"></a><a href="#BkIN_33">33</a>. Haec erat illis disciplina a
  Platone tradita: cuius quas acceperim mutationes, si voltis, exponam. Nos
  vero volumus, inquam, ut pro Attico etiam respondeam.</p>

  <p>IX. Et recte, inquit, respondes: praeclare enim explicatur
  Peripateticorum et Academiae veteris auctoritas. Aristoteles primus
  species, quas paulo ante dixi, labefactavit: quas mirifice Plato erat
  amplexatus, ut in iis quiddam divinum esse diceret. Theophrastus autem,
  vir et oratione suavis et ita moratus, ut prae se probitatem quandam et
  ingenuitatem ferat, vehementius etiam fregit quodam modo auctoritatem
  veteris disciplinae: spoliavit enim virtutem suo decore imbecillamque
  reddidit, quod negavit in ea sola positum esse beate vivere. <a
  name="BkI_34"></a><a href="#BkIN_34">34</a>. Nam Strato, eius auditor,
  quamquam fuit acri ingenio, tamen ab ea disciplina omnino semovendus est:
  qui cum maxime necessariam partem philosophiae, quae posita est in
  virtute et moribus, reliquisset totumque se ad investigationem naturae
  contulisset, in ea ipsa plurimum dissedit a suis. Speusippus autem et
  Xenocrates, qui primi Platonis rationem auctoritatemque susceperant, et
  post eos Polemo et Crates unaque Crantor, in Academia congregati,
  diligenter ea, quae a superioribus acceperant, tuebantur. Iam Polemonem
  audiverant adsidue Zeno et Arcesilas. <a name="BkI_35"></a><a
  href="#BkIN_35">35</a>. Sed Zeno cum Arcesilam anteiret aetate valdeque
  subtiliter dissereret et peracute moveretur, corrigere conatus est
  disciplinam. Eam quoque, si videtur, correctionem explicabo, sicut
  solebat Antiochus. Mihi vero, inquam, videtur, quod vides idem
  significare Pomponium.</p>

  <p>X. Zeno igitur nullo modo is erat, qui, ut Theophrastus, nervos
  virtutis inciderit, sed contra, qui omnia quae ad beatam vitam
  pertinerent in una virtute poneret nec quicquam aliud numeraret in bonis,
  idque appellaret honestum, quod esset simplex quoddam et solum et unum
  bonum. <a name="BkI_36"></a><a href="#BkIN_36">36</a>. Cetera autem etsi
  nec bona nec mala essent, tamen alia secundum naturam dicebat, alia
  naturae esse contraria. His ipsis alia interiecta et media numerabat.
  Quae autem secundum naturam essent, ea sumenda et quadam aestimatione
  dignanda docebat, contraque contraria: neutra autem in mediis
  relinquebat, in quibus ponebat nihil omnino esse momenti. <a
  name="BkI_37"></a><a href="#BkIN_37">37</a>. Sed quae essent sumenda, ex
  iis alia pluris esse aestimanda, alia minoris. Quae pluris, ea praeposita
  appellabat, reiecta autem quae minoris. Atque ut haec non tam rebus quam
  vocabulis commutaverat, sic inter recte factum atque peccatum, officium
  et contra officium media locabat quaedam: recte facta sola in bonis
  actionibus ponens, prave, id est peccata, in malis: officia autem servata
  praetermissaque media putabat, ut dixi. <a name="BkI_38"></a><a
  href="#BkIN_38">38</a>. Cumque superiores non omnem virtutem in ratione
  esse dicerent, sed quasdam virtutes natura aut more perfectas, hic omnis
  in ratione ponebat, cumque illi ea genera virtutum, quae supra dixi,
  seiungi posse arbitrarentur, hic nec id ullo modo fieri posse disserebat
  nec virtutis usum modo, ut superiores, sed ipsum habitum per se esse
  praeclarum, nec tamen virtutem cuiquam adesse quin ea semper uteretur.
  Cumque perturbationem animi illi ex homine non tollerent, naturaque et
  condolescere et concupiscere et extimescere et efferri laetitia dicerent,
  sed eas contraherent in angustumque deducerent, hic omnibus his quasi
  morbis voluit carere sapientem. <a name="BkI_39"></a><a
  href="#BkIN_39">39</a>. Cumque eas perturbationes antiqui naturalis esse
  dicerent et rationis expertis aliaque in parte animi cupiditatem, alia
  rationem collocarent, ne his quidem adsentiebatur. Nam et perturbationes
  voluntarias esse putabat opinionisque iudicio suscipi et omnium
  perturbationum arbitrabatur matrem esse immoderatam quamdam
  intemperantiam. Haec fere de moribus.</p>

  <p>XI. De naturis autem sic sentiebat, primum, ut quattuor initiis rerum
  illis quintam hanc naturam, ex qua superiores sensus et mentem effici
  rebantur, non adhiberet. Statuebat enim ignem esse ipsam naturam, quae
  quidque gigneret, et mentem atque sensus. Discrepabat etiam ab isdem quod
  nullo modo arbitrabatur quicquam effici posse ab ea, quae expers esset
  corporis, cuius generis Xenocrates et superiores etiam animum esse
  dixerant, nec vero aut quod efficeret aliquid aut quod efficeretur posse
  esse non corpus. <a name="BkI_40"></a><a href="#BkIN_40">40</a>. Plurima
  autem in illa tertia philosophiae parte mutavit. In qua primum de
  sensibus ipsis quaedam dixit nova, quos iunctos esse censuit e quadam
  quasi impulsione oblata extrinsecus, quam ille <span lang="el"
  title="phantasian"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</span>,
  nos visum appellemus licet, et teneamus hoc verbum quidem: erit enim
  utendum in reliquo sermone saepius. Sed ad haec, quae visa sunt et quasi
  accepta sensibus, adsensionem adiungit animorum, quam esse volt in nobis
  positam et voluntariam. <a name="BkI_41"></a><a href="#BkIN_41">41</a>.
  Visis non omnibus adiungebat fidem, sed iis solum, quae propriam quandam
  haberent declarationem earum rerum, quae viderentur: id autem visum, cum
  ipsum per se cerneretur, comprehendibile&mdash;feretis hoc? Nos vero,
  inquit. Quonam enim modo <span lang="el" title="katalêpton"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>
  diceres?&mdash;Sed, cum acceptum iam et approbatum esset, comprehensionem
  appellabat, similem iis rebus, quae manu prehenderentur: ex quo etiam
  nomen hoc duxerat, cum eo verbo antea nemo tali in re usus esset,
  plurimisque idem novis verbis&mdash;nova enim dicebat&mdash;usus est.
  Quod autem erat sensu comprehensum, id ipsum sensum appellabat, et si ita
  erat comprehensum, ut convelli ratione non posset, scientiam: sin aliter,
  inscientiam nominabat: ex qua exsisteret etiam opinio, quae esset
  imbecilla et cum falso incognitoque communis. <a name="BkI_42"></a><a
  href="#BkIN_42">42</a>. Sed inter scientiam et inscientiam
  comprehensionem illam, quam dixi, collocabat, eamque neque in rectis
  neque in pravis numerabat, sed soli credendum esse dicebat. E quo
  sensibus etiam fidem tribuebat, quod, ut supra dixi, comprehensio facta
  sensibus et vera esse illi et fidelis videbatur, non quod omnia, quae
  essent in re, comprehenderet, sed quia nihil quod cadere in eam posset
  relinqueret quodque natura quasi normam scientiae et principium sui
  dedisset, unde postea notiones rerum in animis imprimerentur, e quibus
  non principia solum, sed latiores quaedam ad rationem inveniendam viae
  reperiuntur. Errorem autem et temeritatem et ignorantiam et opinationem
  et suspicionem et uno nomine omnia, quae essent aliena firmae et
  constantis adsensionis, a virtute sapientiaque removebat. Atque in his
  fere commutatio constitit omnis dissensioque Zenonis a superioribus.</p>

  <p>XII. <a name="BkI_43"></a><a href="#BkIN_43">43</a>. Quae cum
  dixisset: Breviter sane minimeque obscure exposita est, inquam, a te,
  Varro, et veteris Academiae ratio et Stoicorum: verum esse [autem]
  arbitror, ut Antiocho, nostro familiari, placebat, correctionem veteris
  Academiae potius quam aliquam novam disciplinam putandam. Tunc Varro:
  Tuae sunt nunc partes, inquit, qui ab antiquorum ratione desciscis et ea,
  quae ab Arcesila novata sunt, probas, docere quod et qua de causa
  discidium factum sit, ut videamus satisne ista sit iusta defectio. <a
  name="BkI_44"></a><a href="#BkIN_44">44</a>. Tum ego: Cum Zenone, inquam,
  ut accepimus, Arcesilas sibi omne certamen instituit, non pertinacia aut
  studio vincendi, ut mihi quidem videtur, sed earum rerum obscuritate,
  quae ad confessionem ignorationis adduxerant Socratem et iam ante
  Socratem Democritum, Anaxagoram, Empedoclem, omnis paene veteres: qui
  nihil cognosci, nihil percipi, nihil sciri posse dixerunt: angustos
  sensus, imbecillos animos, brevia curricula vitae et, ut Democritus, in
  profundo veritatem esse demersam, opinionibus et institutis omnia teneri,
  nihil veritati relinqui, deinceps omnia tenebris circumfusa esse
  dixerunt. <a name="BkI_45"></a><a href="#BkIN_45">45</a>. Itaque
  Arcesilas negabat esse quicquam quod sciri posset, ne illud quidem ipsum,
  quod Socrates sibi reliquisset: sic omnia latere censebat in occulto:
  neque esse quicquam quod cerni aut intellegi posset: quibus de causis
  nihil oportere neque profiteri neque adfirmare quemquam neque adsensione
  approbare, cohibereque semper et ab omni lapsu continere temeritatem,
  quae tum esset insignis, cum aut falsa aut incognita res approbaretur,
  neque hoc quicquam esse turpius quam cognitioni et perceptioni
  adsensionem approbationemque praecurrere. Huic rationi quod erat
  consentaneum faciebat, ut contra omnium sententias dicens in eam
  plerosque deduceret, ut cum in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus
  momenta rationum invenirentur, facilius ab utraque parte adsensio
  sustineretur. <a name="BkI_46"></a><a href="#BkIN_46">46</a>. Hanc
  Academiam novam appellant, quae mihi vetus videtur, si quidem Platonem ex
  illa vetere numeramus, cuius in libris nihil adfirmatur et in utramque
  partem multa disseruntur, de omnibus quaeritur, nihil certi dicitur: sed
  tamen illa, quam exposui<i>sti</i>, vetus, haec nova nominetur: quae
  usque ad Carneadem perducta, qui quartus ab Arcesila fuit, in eadem
  Arcesilae ratione permansit. Carneades autem nullius philosophiae partis
  ignarus et, ut cognovi ex iis, qui illum audierant, maximeque ex Epicureo
  Zenone, qui cum ab eo plurimum dissentiret, unum tamen praeter ceteros
  mirabatur, incredibili quadam fuit facultate....</p>

<h2>ACADEMICORUM PRIORUM</h2>

<h3>LIBER II.</h3>

  <p>I. <a name="BkII_1"></a><a href="#BkIIN_1">1</a>. Magnum ingenium Luci
  Luculli magnumque optimarum artium studium, tum omnis liberalis et digna
  homine nobili ab eo percepta doctrina, quibus temporibus florere in foro
  maxime potuit, caruit omnino rebus urbanis. Ut enim admodum adolescens
  cum fratre pari pietate et industria praedito paternas inimicitias magna
  cum gloria est persecutus, in Asiam quaestor profectus, ibi permultos
  annos admirabili quadam laude provinciae praefuit; deinde absens factus
  aedilis, continuo praetor&mdash;licebat enim celerius legis
  praemio&mdash;, post in Africam, inde ad consulatum, quem ita gessit ut
  diligentiam admirarentur omnes, ingenium cognoscerent. Post ad
  Mithridaticum bellum missus a senatu non modo opinionem vicit omnium,
  quae de virtute eius erat, sed etiam gloriam superiorum. <a
  name="BkII_2"></a><a href="#BkIIN_2">2</a>. Idque eo fuit mirabilius,
  quod ab eo laus imperatoria non admodum exspectabatur, qui adolescentiam
  in forensi opera, quaesturae diuturnum tempus Murena bellum in Ponto
  gerente in Asia pace consumpserat. Sed incredibilis quaedam ingeni
  magnitudo non desideravit indocilem usus disciplinam. Itaque cum totum
  iter et navigationem consumpsisset partim in percontando a peritis,
  partim in rebus gestis legendis, in Asiam factus imperator venit, cum
  esset Roma profectus rei militaris rudis. Habuit enim divinam quandam
  memoriam rerum, verborum maiorem Hortensius, sed quo plus in negotiis
  gerendis res quam verba prosunt, hoc erat memoria illa praestantior, quam
  fuisse in Themistocle, quem facile Graeciae principem ponimus, singularem
  ferunt: qui quidem etiam pollicenti cuidam se artem ei memoriae, quae tum
  primum proferebatur, traditurum respondisse dicitur oblivisci se malle
  discere, credo, quod haerebant in memoria quaecumque audierat et viderat.
  Tali ingenio praeditus Lucullus adiunxerat etiam illam, quam Themistocles
  spreverat, disciplinam. Itaque ut litteris consignamus quae monumentis
  mandare volumus, sic ille in animo res insculptas habebat. <a
  name="BkII_3"></a><a href="#BkIIN_3">3</a>. Tantus ergo imperator in omni
  genere belli fuit, proeliis, oppugnationibus, navalibus pugnis totiusque
  belli instrumento et apparatu, ut ille rex post Alexandrum maximus hunc a
  se maiorem ducem cognitum quam quemquam eorum, quos legisset, fateretur.
  In eodem tanta prudentia fuit in constituendis temperandisque
  civitatibus, tanta aequitas, ut hodie stet Asia Luculli institutis
  servandis et quasi vestigiis persequendis. Sed etsi magna cum utilitate
  rei publicae, tamen diutius quam vellem tanta vis virtutis atque ingeni
  peregrinata afuit ab oculis et fori et curiae. Quin etiam, cum victor a
  Mithridatico bello revertisset, inimicorum calumnia triennio tardius quam
  debuerat triumphavit. Nos enim consules introduximus paene in urbem
  currum clarissimi viri: cuius mihi consilium et auctoritas quid tum in
  maximis rebus profuisset dicerem, nisi de me ipso dicendum esset: quod
  hoc tempore non est necesse. Itaque privabo illum potius debito
  testimonio quam id cum mea laude communicem.</p>

  <p>II. <a name="BkII_4"></a><a href="#BkIIN_4">4</a>. Sed quae populari
  gloria decorari in Lucullo debuerunt, ea fere sunt et Graecis litteris
  celebrata et Latinis. Nos autem illa externa cum multis, haec interiora
  cum paucis ex ipso saepe cognovimus. Maiore enim studio Lucullus cum omni
  litterarum generi tum philosophiae deditus fuit quam qui illum ignorabant
  arbitrabantur, nec vero ineunte aetate solum, sed et pro quaestore
  aliquot annos et in ipso bello, in quo ita magna rei militaris esse
  occupatio solet, ut non multum imperatori sub ipsis pellibus otii
  relinquatur. Cum autem e philosophis ingenio scientiaque putaretur
  Antiochus, Philonis auditor, excellere, eum secum et quaestor habuit et
  post aliquot annos imperator, cumque esset ea memoria, quam ante dixi, ea
  saepe audiendo facile cognovit, quae vel semel audita meminisse
  potuisset. Delectabatur autem mirifice lectione librorum, de quibus
  audiebat.</p>

  <p><a name="BkII_5"></a><a href="#BkIIN_5">5</a>. Ac vereor interdum ne
  talium personarum cum amplificare velim, minuam etiam gloriam. Sunt enim
  multi qui omnino Graecas non ament litteras, plures qui philosophiam,
  reliqui, etiam si haec non improbent, tamen earum rerum disputationem
  principibus civitatis non ita decoram putant. Ego autem, cum Graecas
  litteras M. Catonem in senectute didicisse acceperim, P. autem Africani
  historiae loquantur in legatione illa nobili, quam ante censuram obiit,
  Panaetium unum omnino comitem fuisse, nec litterarum Graecarum nec
  philosophiae iam ullum auctorem requiro. <a name="BkII_6"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_6">6</a>. Restat ut iis respondeam, qui sermonibus eius modi
  nolint personas tam gravis illigari. Quasi vero clarorum virorum aut
  tacitos congressus esse oporteat aut ludicros sermones aut rerum
  colloquia leviorum! Etenim, si quodam in libro vere est a nobis
  philosophia laudata, profecto eius tractatio optimo atque amplissimo
  quoque dignissima est, nec quicquam aliud videndum est nobis, quos
  populus Romanus hoc in gradu collocavit, nisi ne quid privatis studiis de
  opera publica detrahamus. Quod si, cum fungi munere debebamus, non modo
  operam nostram numquam a populari coetu removimus, sed ne litteram quidem
  ullam fecimus nisi forensem, quis reprehendet nostrum otium, qui in eo
  non modo nosmet ipsos hebescere et languere nolumus, sed etiam ut
  plurimis prosimus enitimur? Gloriam vero non modo non minui, sed etiam
  augeri arbitramur eorum, quorum ad popularis illustrisque laudes has
  etiam minus notas minusque pervolgatas adiungimus. <a
  name="BkII_7"></a><a href="#BkIIN_7">7</a>. Sunt etiam qui negent in iis,
  qui in nostris libris disputent, fuisse earum rerum, de quibus
  disputatur, scientiam: qui mihi videntur non solum vivis, sed etiam
  mortuis invidere.</p>

  <p>III. Restat unum genus reprehensorum, quibus Academiae ratio non
  probatur. Quod gravius ferremus, si quisquam ullam disciplinam
  philosophiae probaret praeter eam, quam ipse sequeretur. Nos autem,
  quoniam contra omnis dicere quae videntur solemus, non possumus quin alii
  a nobis dissentiant recusare: quamquam nostra quidem causa facilis est,
  qui verum invenire sine ulla contentione volumus, idque summa cura
  studioque conquirimus. Etsi enim omnis cognitio multis est obstructa
  difficultatibus eaque est et in ipsis rebus obscuritas et in iudiciis
  nostris infirmitas, ut non sine causa antiquissimi et doctissimi invenire
  se posse quod cuperent diffisi sint, tamen nec illi defecerunt neque nos
  studium exquirendi defetigati relinquemus, neque nostrae disputationes
  quicquam aliud agunt nisi ut in utramque partem dicendo eliciant et
  tamquam exprimant aliquid, quod aut verum sit aut ad id quam proxime
  accedat. <a name="BkII_8"></a><a href="#BkIIN_8">8</a>. Neque inter nos
  et eos, qui se scire arbitrantur, quicquam interest, nisi quod illi non
  dubitant quin ea vera sint, quae defendunt: nos probabilia multa habemus,
  quae sequi facile, adfirmare vix possumus. Hoc autem liberiores et
  solutiores sumus, quod integra nobis est iudicandi potestas, nec ut
  omnia, quae praescripta et quasi imperata sint, defendamus necessitate
  ulla cogimur. Nam ceteri primum ante tenentur adstricti quam quid esset
  optimum iudicare potuerunt: deinde infirmissimo tempore aetatis aut
  obsecuti amico cuidam aut una alicuius, quem primum audierunt, oratione
  capti de rebus incognitis iudicant et, ad quamcumque sunt disciplinam
  quasi tempestate delati, ad eam tamquam ad saxum adhaerescunt. <a
  name="BkII_9"></a><a href="#BkIIN_9">9</a>. Nam, quod dicunt omnino se
  credere ei, quem iudicent fuisse sapientem, probarem, si id ipsum rudes
  et indocti iudicare potuissent&mdash;statuere enim qui sit sapiens vel
  maxime videtur esse sapientis&mdash;, sed ut potuerint, potuerunt omnibus
  rebus auditis, cognitis etiam reliquorum sententiis, iudicaverunt autem
  re semel audita atque ad unius se auctoritatem contulerunt. Sed nescio
  quo modo plerique errare malunt eamque sententiam, quam adamaverunt,
  pugnacissime defendere quam sine pertinacia quid constantissime dicatur
  exquirere. Quibus de rebus et alias saepe multa quaesita et disputata
  sunt et quondam in Hortensii villa, quae est ad Baulos, cum eo Catulus et
  Lucullus nosque ipsi postridie venissemus, quam apud Catulum fuissemus.
  Quo quidem etiam maturius venimus, quod erat constitutum, si ventus
  esset, Lucullo in Neapolitanum, mihi in Pompeianum navigare. Cum igitur
  pauca in xysto locuti essemus, tum eodem in spatio consedimus.</p>

  <p>IV. <a name="BkII_10"></a><a href="#BkIIN_10">10</a>. Hic Catulus:
  Etsi heri, inquit, id, quod quaerebatur, paene explicatum est, ut tota
  fere quaestio tractata videatur, tamen exspecto ea, quae te pollicitus
  es, Luculle, ab Antiocho audita dicturum. Equidem, inquit Hortensius,
  feci plus quam vellem: totam enim rem Lucullo integram servatam oportuit.
  Et tamen fortasse servata est: a me enim ea, quae in promptu erant, dicta
  sunt, a Lucullo autem reconditiora desidero. Tum ille: Non sane, inquit,
  Hortensi, conturbat me exspectatio tua, etsi nihil est iis, qui placere
  volunt, tam adversarium, sed quia non laboro quam valde ea, quae dico,
  probaturus sim, eo minus conturbor. Dicam enim nec mea nec ea, in quibus,
  si non fuerint, <i>non</i> vinci me malim quam vincere. Sed mehercule, ut
  quidem nunc se causa habet, etsi hesterno sermone labefactata est, mihi
  tamen videtur esse verissima. Agam igitur, sicut Antiochus agebat: nota
  enim mihi res est. Nam et vacuo animo illum audiebam et magno studio,
  eadem de re etiam saepius, ut etiam maiorem exspectationem mei faciam
  quam modo fecit Hortensius. Cum ita esset exorsus, ad audiendum animos
  ereximus. <a name="BkII_11"></a><a href="#BkIIN_11">11</a>. At ille: Cum
  Alexandriae pro quaestore, inquit, essem, fuit Antiochus mecum et erat
  iam antea Alexandriae familiaris Antiochi Heraclitus Tyrius, qui et
  Clitomachum multos annos et Philonem audierat, homo sane in ista
  philosophia, quae nunc prope dimissa revocatur, probatus et nobilis: cum
  quo Antiochum saepe disputantem audiebam, sed utrumque leniter. Et quidem
  isti libri duo Philonis, de quibus heri dictum a Catulo est, tum erant
  adlati Alexandriam tumque primum in Antiochi manus venerant: et homo
  natura lenissimus&mdash;nihil enim poterat fieri illo
  mitius&mdash;stomachari tamen coepit. Mirabar: nec enim umquam ante
  videram. At ille, Heracliti memoriam implorans, quaerere ex eo
  viderenturne illa Philonis aut ea num vel e Philone vel ex ullo Academico
  audivisset aliquando? Negabat. Philonis tamen scriptum agnoscebat: nec id
  quidem dubitari poterat: nam aderant mei familiares, docti homines, P. et
  C. Selii et Tetrilius Rogus, qui se illa audivisse Romae de Philone et ab
  eo ipso illos duos libros dicerent descripsisse. <a name="BkII_12"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_12">12</a>. Tum et illa dixit Antiochus, quae heri Catulus
  commemoravit a patre suo dicta Philoni, et alia plura, nec se tenuit quin
  contra suum doctorem librum etiam ederet, qui Sosus inscribitur. Tum
  igitur et cum Heraclitum studiose audirem contra Antiochum disserentem et
  item Antiochum contra Academicos, dedi Antiocho operam diligentius, ut
  causam ex eo totam cognoscerem. Itaque compluris dies adhibito Heraclito
  doctisque compluribus et in iis Antiochi fratre, Aristo, et praeterea
  Aristone et Dione, quibus ille secundum fratrem plurimum tribuebat,
  multum temporis in ista una disputatione consumpsimus. Sed ea pars, quae
  contra Philonem erat, praetermittenda est: minus enim acer est
  adversarius is, qui ista, quae sunt heri defensa, negat Academicos omnino
  dicere. Etsi enim mentitur, tamen est adversarius lenior. Ad Arcesilam
  Carneademque veniamus.</p>

  <p>V. <a name="BkII_13"></a><a href="#BkIIN_13">13</a>. Quae cum
  dixisset, sic rursus exorsus est: Primum mihi videmini&mdash;me autem
  nomine appellabat, cum veteres physicos nominatis, facere idem, quod
  seditiosi cives solent, cum aliquos ex antiquis claros viros proferunt,
  quos dicant fuisse popularis, ut eorum ipsi similes esse videantur.
  Repetunt ii a P. Valerio, qui exactis regibus primo anno consul fuit,
  commemorant reliquos, qui leges popularis de provocationibus tulerint,
  cum consules essent; tum ad hos notiores, C. Flaminium, qui legem
  agrariam aliquot annis ante secundum Punicum bellum tribunus plebis
  tulerit invito senatu et postea bis consul factus sit, L. Cassium, Q.
  Pompeium: illi quidem etiam P. Africanum referre in eundem numerum
  solent. Duos vero sapientissimos et clarissimos fratres, P. Crassum et P.
  Scaevolam, aiunt Ti. Graccho auctores legum fuisse, alterum quidem, ut
  videmus, palam, alterum, ut suspicantur, obscurius. Addunt etiam C.
  Marium. Et de hoc quidem nihil mentiuntur. Horum nominibus tot virorum
  atque tantorum expositis eorum se institutum sequi dicunt. <a
  name="BkII_14"></a><a href="#BkIIN_14">14</a>. Similiter vos, cum
  perturbare, ut illi rem publicam, sic vos philosophiam bene iam
  constitutam velitis, Empedoclem, Anaxagoram, Democritum, Parmenidem,
  Xenophanem, Platonem etiam et Socratem profertis. Sed neque Saturninus,
  ut nostrum inimicum potissimum nominem, simile quicquam habuit veterum
  illorum nec Arcesilae calumnia conferenda est cum Democriti verecundia.
  Et tamen isti physici raro admodum, cum haerent aliquo loco, exclamant
  quasi mente incitati, Empedocles quidem, ut interdum mihi furere
  videatur, abstrusa esse omnia, nihil nos sentire, nihil cernere, nihil
  omnino quale sit posse reperire: maiorem autem partem mihi quidem omnes
  isti videntur nimis etiam quaedam adfirmare plusque profiteri se scire
  quam sciant. <a name="BkII_15"></a><a href="#BkIIN_15">15</a>. Quod si
  illi tum in novis rebus quasi modo nascentes haesitaverunt, nihilne tot
  saeculis, summis ingeniis, maximis studiis explicatum putamus? nonne, cum
  iam philosophorum disciplinae gravissimae constitissent, tum exortus est
  ut in optima re publica Ti. Gracchus qui otium perturbaret, sic Arcesilas
  qui constitutam philosophiam everteret et in eorum auctoritate
  delitisceret, qui negavissent quicquam sciri aut percipi posse? quorum e
  numero tollendus est et Plato et Socrates: alter, quia reliquit
  perfectissimam disciplinam, Peripateticos et Academicos, nominibus
  differentis, re congruentis, a quibus Stoici ipsi verbis magis quam
  sententiis dissenserunt. Socrates autem de se ipse detrahens in
  disputatione plus tribuebat iis, quos volebat refellere. Ita, cum aliud
  agnosceret atque sentiret, libenter uti solitus est ea dissimulatione,
  quam Graeci <span lang="el" title="eirôneian"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C1;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</span>
  vocant: quam ait etiam in Africano fuisse Fannius, idque propterea
  vitiosum in illo non putandum, quod idem fuerit in Socrate.</p>

  <p>VI. <a name="BkII_16"></a><a href="#BkIIN_16">16</a>. Sed fuerint illa
  veteribus, si voltis, incognita. Nihilne est igitur actum, quod
  investigata sunt, postea quam Arcesilas Zenoni, ut putatur, obtrectans
  nihil novi reperienti, sed emendanti superiores immutatione verborum, dum
  huius definitiones labefactare volt, conatus est clarissimis rebus
  tenebras obducere? Cuius primo non admodum probata ratio, quamquam
  floruit cum acumine ingeni tum admirabili quodam lepore dicendi, proxime
  a Lacyde solo retenta est: post autem confecta a Carneade, qui est
  quartus ab Arcesila: audivit enim Hegesinum, qui Euandrum audierat,
  Lacydi discipulum, cum Arcesilae Lacydes fuisset. Sed ipse Carneades diu
  tenuit: nam nonaginta vixit annos, et qui illum audierant, admodum
  floruerunt: e quibus industriae plurimum in Clitomacho
  fuit&mdash;declarat multitudo librorum&mdash;ingeni non minus in
  [Aeschine], in Charmada eloquentiae, in Melanthio Rhodio suavitatis. Bene
  autem nosse Carneadem Stratoniceus Metrodorus putabatur. <a
  name="BkII_17"></a><a href="#BkIIN_17">17</a>. Iam Clitomacho Philo
  vester operam multos annos dedit. Philone autem vivo patrocinium
  Academiae non defuit. Sed, quod nos facere nunc ingredimur, ut contra
  Academicos disseramus, id quidam e philosophis et ii quidem non mediocres
  faciendum omnino non putabant: nec vero esse ullam rationem disputare cum
  iis, qui nihil probarent, Antipatrumque Stoicum, qui multus in eo
  fuisset, reprehendebant, nec definiri aiebant necesse esse quid esset
  cognitio aut perceptio aut, si verbum e verbo volumus, comprehensio, quam
  <span lang="el" title="katalêpsin"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C8;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>
  illi vocant, eosque, qui persuadere vellent, esse aliquid quod
  comprehendi et percipi posset, inscienter facere dicebant, propterea quod
  nihil esset clarius <span lang="el" title="enargeiai"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>,
  ut Graeci: perspicuitatem aut evidentiam nos, si placet, nominemus
  fabricemurque, si opus erit, verba, ne hic sibi&mdash;me appellabat
  iocans&mdash;hoc licere putet soli: sed tamen orationem nullam putabant
  illustriorem ipsa evidentia reperiri posse nec ea, quae tam clara essent,
  definienda censebant. Alii autem negabant se pro hac evidentia quicquam
  priores fuisse dicturos, sed ad ea, quae contra dicerentur, dici oportere
  putabant, ne qui fallerentur. <a name="BkII_18"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_18">18</a>. Plerique tamen et definitiones ipsarum etiam
  evidentium rerum non improbant et rem idoneam, de qua quaeratur, et
  homines dignos, quibuscum disseratur, putant. Philo autem, dum nova
  quaedam commovet, quod ea sustinere vix poterat, quae contra Academicorum
  pertinaciam dicebantur, et aperte mentitur, ut est reprehensus a patre
  Catulo, et, ut docuit Antiochus, in id ipsum se induit, quod timebat. Cum
  enim ita negaret, quicquam esse, quod comprehendi posset&mdash;id enim
  volumus esse <span lang="el" title="akatalêpton"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>&mdash;,
  si illud esset, sicut Zeno definiret, tale visum&mdash;iam enim hoc pro
  <span lang="el" title="phantasiai"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>
  verbum satis hesterno sermone trivimus&mdash;visum igitur impressum
  effictumque ex eo, unde esset, quale esse non posset, ex eo, unde non
  esset, id nos a Zenone definitum rectissime dicimus: qui enim potest
  quicquam comprehendi, ut plane confidas perceptum id cognitumque esse,
  quod est tale, quale vel falsum esse possit? hoc cum infirmat tollitque
  Philo, iudicium tollit incogniti et cogniti: ex quo efficitur nihil posse
  comprehendi. Ita imprudens eo, quo minime volt, revolvitur. Qua re omnis
  oratio contra Academiam suscipitur a nobis, ut retineamus eam
  definitionem, quam Philo voluit evertere. Quam nisi obtinemus, percipi
  nihil posse concedimus.</p>

  <p>VII. <a name="BkII_19"></a><a href="#BkIIN_19">19</a>. Ordiamur igitur
  a sensibus: quorum ita clara iudicia et certa sunt, ut, si optio naturae
  nostrae detur, et ab ea deus aliqui requirat contentane sit suis integris
  incorruptisque sensibus an postulet melius aliquid, non videam quid
  quaerat amplius. Nec vero hoc loco exspectandum est, dum de remo inflexo
  aut de collo columbae respondeam: non enim is sum, qui quidquid videtur
  tale dicam esse quale videatur. Epicurus hoc viderit et alia multa. Meo
  autem iudicio ita est maxima in sensibus veritas, si et sani sunt ac
  valentes et omnia removentur, quae obstant et impediunt. Itaque et lumen
  mutari saepe volumus et situs earum rerum, quas intuemur, et intervalla
  aut contrahimus aut diducimus, multaque facimus usque eo, dum adspectus
  ipse fidem faciat sui iudicii. Quod idem fit in vocibus, in odore, in
  sapore, ut nemo sit nostrum qui in sensibus sui cuiusque generis iudicium
  requirat acrius. <a name="BkII_20"></a><a href="#BkIIN_20">20</a>.
  Adhibita vero exercitatione et arte, ut oculi pictura teneantur, aures
  cantibus, quis est quin cernat quanta vis sit in sensibus? Quam multa
  vident pictores in umbris et in eminentia, quae nos non videmus! quam
  multa, quae nos fugiunt in cantu, exaudiunt in eo genere exercitati! qui
  primo inflatu tibicinis Antiopam esse aiunt aut Andromacham, quum id nos
  ne suspicemur quidem. Nihil necesse est de gustatu et odoratu loqui, in
  quibus intellegentia, etsi vitiosa, est quaedam tamen. Quid de tactu, et
  eo quidem, quem philosophi interiorem vocant, aut doloris aut voluptatis?
  in quo Cyrenaici solo putant veri esse iudicium, quia
  sentiatur:&mdash;potestne igitur quisquam dicere inter eum, qui doleat,
  et inter eum, qui in voluptate sit, nihil interesse? aut, ita qui sentiet
  non apertissime insaniat? <a name="BkII_21"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_21">21</a>. Atqui qualia sunt haec, quae sensibus percipi
  dicimus, talia secuntur ea, quae non sensibus ipsis percipi dicuntur, sed
  quodam modo sensibus, ut haec: 'illud est album, hoc dulce, canorum
  illud, hoc bene olens, hoc asperum.' Animo iam haec tenemus comprehensa,
  non sensibus. 'Ille' deinceps 'equus est, ille canis.' Cetera series
  deinde sequitur, maiora nectens, ut haec, quae quasi expletam rerum
  comprehensionem amplectuntur: 'si homo est, animal est mortale, rationis
  particeps.' Quo e genere nobis notitiae rerum imprimuntur, sine quibus
  nec intellegi quicquam nec quaeri disputarive potest. <a
  name="BkII_22"></a><a href="#BkIIN_22">22</a>. Quod si essent falsae
  notitiae&mdash;<span lang="el" title="ennoias"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span> enim notitias
  appellare tu videbare&mdash;, si igitur essent hae falsae aut eius modi
  visis impressae, qualia visa a falsis discerni non possent, quo tandem
  his modo uteremur? quo modo autem quid cuique rei consentaneum esset,
  quid repugnaret videremus? Memoriae quidem certe, quae non modo
  philosophiam, sed omnis vitae usus omnisque artis una maxime continet,
  nihil omnino loci relinquitur. Quae potest enim esse memoria falsorum?
  aut quid quisquam meminit, quod non animo comprehendit et tenet? Ars vero
  quae potest esse nisi quae non ex una aut duabus, sed ex multis animi
  perceptionibus constat? Quam si subtraxeris, qui distingues artificem ab
  inscio? Non enim fortuito hunc artificem dicemus esse, illum negabimus,
  sed cum alterum percepta et comprehensa tenere videmus, alterum non item.
  Cumque artium aliud eius modi genus sit, ut tantum modo animo rem cernat,
  aliud, ut moliatur aliquid et faciat, quo modo aut geometres cernere ea
  potest, quae aut nulla sunt aut internosci a falsis non possunt, aut is,
  qui fidibus utitur, explere numeros et conficere versus? Quod idem in
  similibus quoque artibus continget, quarum omne opus est in faciendo
  atque agendo. Quid enim est quod arte effici possit, nisi is, qui artem
  tractabit, multa perceperit?</p>

  <p>VIII. <a name="BkII_23"></a><a href="#BkIIN_23">23</a>. Maxime vero
  virtutum cognitio confirmat percipi et comprehendi multa posse. In quibus
  solis inesse etiam scientiam dicimus, quam nos non comprehensionem modo
  rerum, sed eam stabilem quoque et immutabilem esse censemus, itemque
  sapientiam, artem vivendi, quae ipsa ex sese habeat constantiam. Ea autem
  constantia si nihil habeat percepti et cogniti, quaero unde nata sit aut
  quo modo? Quaero etiam, ille vir bonus, qui statuit omnem cruciatum
  perferre, intolerabili dolore lacerari potius quam aut officium prodat
  aut fidem, cur has igitur sibi tam gravis leges imposuerit, cum quam ob
  rem ita oporteret nihil haberet comprehensi, percepti, cogniti,
  constituti? Nullo igitur modo fieri potest ut quisquam tanti aestimet
  aequitatem et fidem, ut eius conservandae causa nullum supplicium
  recuset, nisi iis rebus adsensus sit, quae falsae esse non possint. <a
  name="BkII_24"></a><a href="#BkIIN_24">24</a>. Ipsa vero sapientia, si se
  ignorabit sapientia sit necne, quo modo primum obtinebit nomen
  sapientiae? deinde quo modo suscipere aliquam rem aut agere fidenter
  audebit, cum certi nihil erit quod sequatur? cum vero dubitabit quid sit
  extremum et ultimum bonorum, ignorans quo omnia referantur, qui poterit
  esse sapientia? Atque etiam illud perspicuum est, constitui necesse esse
  initium, quod sapientia, cum quid agere incipiat, sequatur, idque initium
  esse naturae accommodatum. Nam aliter appetitio&mdash;eam enim volumus
  esse <span lang="el" title="hormên"
  >&#x201B;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3BC;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;</span>&mdash;, qua ad
  agendum impellimur, et id appetimus, quod est visum, moveri non potest.
  <a name="BkII_25"></a><a href="#BkIIN_25">25</a>. Illud autem, quod
  movet, prius oportet videri eique credi: quod fieri non potest, si id,
  quod visum erit, discerni non poterit a falso. Quo modo autem moveri
  animus ad appetendum potest, si id, quod videtur, non percipitur
  accommodatumne naturae sit an alienum? Itemque, si quid offici sui sit
  non occurrit animo, nihil umquam omnino aget, ad nullam rem umquam
  impelletur, numquam movebitur. Quod si aliquid aliquando acturus est,
  necesse est id ei verum, quod occurrit, videri. <a name="BkII_26"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_26">26</a>. Quid quod, si ista vera sunt, ratio omnis
  tollitur, quasi quaedam lux lumenque vitae, tamenne in ista pravitate
  perstabitis? Nam quaerendi initium ratio attulit, quae perfecit virtutem,
  cum esset ipsa ratio confirmata quaerendo. Quaestio autem est appetitio
  cognitionis quaestionisque finis inventio. At nemo invenit falsa, nec ea,
  quae incerta permanent, inventa esse possunt, sed, cum ea, quae quasi
  involuta fuerunt, aperta sunt, tum inventa dicuntur. Sic et initium
  quaerendi et exitus percipiendi et comprehendendi tenet<i>ur</i>. Itaque
  argumenti conclusio, quae est Graece <span lang="el" title="apodeixis"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>,
  ita definitur: 'ratio, quae ex rebus perceptis ad id, quod non
  percipiebatur, adducit.'</p>

  <p>IX. <a name="BkII_27"></a><a href="#BkIIN_27">27</a>. Quod si omnia
  visa eius modi essent, qualia isti dicunt, ut ea vel falsa esse possent,
  neque ea posset ulla notio discernere, quo modo quemquam aut conclusisse
  aliquid aut invenisse diceremus aut quae esset conclusi argumenti fides?
  Ipsa autem philosophia, quae rationibus progredi debet, quem habebit
  exitum? Sapientiae vero quid futurum est? quae neque de se ipsa dubitare
  debet neque de suis decretis, quae philosophi vocant <span lang="el"
  title="dogmata"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>, quorum nullum
  sine scelere prodi poterit. Cum enim decretum proditur, lex veri rectique
  proditur, quo e vitio et amicitiarum proditiones et rerum publicarum
  nasci solent. Non potest igitur dubitari quin decretum nullum falsum
  possit esse sapientique satis non sit non esse falsum, sed etiam stabile,
  fixum, ratum esse debeat, quod movere nulla ratio queat. Talia autem
  neque esse neque videri possunt eorum ratione, qui illa visa, e quibus
  omnia decreta sunt nata, negant quicquam a falsis interesse. <a
  name="BkII_28"></a><a href="#BkIIN_28">28</a>. Ex hoc illud est natum,
  quod postulabat Hortensius, ut id ipsum saltem perceptum a sapiente
  diceretis, nihil posse percipi. Sed Antipatro hoc idem postulanti, cum
  diceret ei, qui adfirmaret nihil posse percipi, consentaneum esse unum
  tamen illud dicere percipi posse, ut alia non possent, Carneades acutius
  resistebat. Nam tantum abesse dicebat, ut id consentaneum esset, ut
  maxime etiam repugnaret. Qui enim negaret quicquam esse quod
  perciperetur, eum nihil excipere: ita necesse esse, ne id ipsum quidem,
  quod exceptum non esset, comprehendi et percipi ullo modo posse. <a
  name="BkII_29"></a><a href="#BkIIN_29">29</a>. Antiochus ad istum locum
  pressius videbatur accedere. Quoniam enim id haberent Academici
  decretum,&mdash;sentitis enim iam hoc me <span lang="el" title="dogma"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;</span> dicere&mdash;, nihil posse
  percipi, non debere eos in suo decreto, sicut in ceteris rebus,
  fluctuare, praesertim cum in eo summa consisteret: hanc enim esse regulam
  totius philosophiae, constitutionem veri falsi, cogniti incogniti: quam
  rationem quoniam susciperent docereque vellent quae vis<i>a</i> accipi
  oporteret et quae repudiari, certe hoc ipsum, ex quo omne veri falsique
  iudicium esset, percipere eos debuisse: etenim duo esse haec maxima in
  philosophia, iudicium veri et finem bonorum, nec sapientem posse esse,
  qui aut cognoscendi esse initium ignoret aut extremum expetendi, ut aut
  unde proficiscatur aut quo perveniendum sit nesciat: haec autem habere
  dubia neque iis ita confidere, ut moveri non possint, abhorrere a
  sapientia plurimum. Hoc igitur modo potius erat ab his postulandum, ut
  hoc unum saltem, percipi nihil posse, perceptum esse dicerent. Sed de
  inconstantia totius illorum sententiae, si ulla sententia cuiusquam esse
  potest nihil approbantis, sit, ut opinor, dictum satis.</p>

  <p>X. <a name="BkII_30"></a><a href="#BkIIN_30">30</a>. Sequitur
  disputatio copiosa illa quidem, sed paulo abstrusior&mdash;habet enim
  aliquantum a physicis&mdash;, ut verear ne maiorem largiar ei, qui contra
  dicturus est, libertatem et licentiam. Nam quid eum facturum putem de
  abditis rebus et obscuris, qui lucem eripere conetur? Sed disputari
  poterat subtiliter, quanto quasi artificio natura fabricata esset primum
  animal omne, deinde hominem maxime, quae vis esset in sensibus, quem ad
  modum primum visa nos pellerent, deinde appetitio ab his pulsa
  sequeretur, tum ut sensus ad res percipiendas intenderemus. Mens enim
  ipsa, quae sensuum fons est atque etiam ipsa sensus est, naturalem vim
  habet, quam intendit ad ea, quibus movetur. Itaque alia visa sic adripit,
  ut iis statim utatur, alia quasi recondit, e quibus memoria oritur.
  Cetera autem similitudinibus construit, ex quibus efficiuntur notitiae
  rerum, quas Graeci tum <span lang="el" title="ennoias"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>, tum <span
  lang="el" title="prolêpseis"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C8;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>
  vocant. Eo cum accessit ratio argumentique conclusio rerumque
  innumerabilium multitudo, tum et perceptio eorum omnium apparet et eadem
  ratio perfecta his gradibus ad sapientiam pervenit. <a
  name="BkII_31"></a><a href="#BkIIN_31">31</a>. Ad rerum igitur scientiam
  vitaeque constantiam aptissima cum sit mens hominis, amplectitur maxime
  cognitionem, et istam <span lang="el" title="katalêpsin"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C8;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>,
  quam, ut dixi, verbum e verbo exprimentes comprehensionem dicemus, cum
  ipsam per se amat&mdash;nihil est enim ei veritatis luce
  dulcius&mdash;tum etiam propter usum. Quocirca et sensibus utitur et
  artis efficit, quasi sensus alteros, et usque eo philosophiam ipsam
  corroborat, ut virtutem efficiat, ex qua re una vita omnis apta sit. Ergo
  ii, qui negant quicquam posse comprehendi, haec ipsa eripiunt vel
  instrumenta vel ornamenta vitae vel potius etiam totam vitam evertunt
  funditus ipsumque animal orbant animo, ut difficile sit de temeritate
  eorum, perinde ut causa postulat, dicere.</p>

  <p><a name="BkII_32"></a><a href="#BkIIN_32">32</a>. Nec vero satis
  constituere possum quod sit eorum consilium aut quid velint. Interdum
  enim cum adhibemus ad eos orationem eius modi: 'Si ea, quae disputentur,
  vera sint, tum omnia fore incerta,' respondent: 'Quid ergo istud ad nos?
  num nostra culpa est? naturam accusa, quae in profundo veritatem, ut ait
  Democritus, penitus abstruserit.' Alii autem elegantius, qui etiam
  queruntur, quod eos insimulemus omnia incerta dicere, quantumque intersit
  inter incertum et id, quod percipi non possit, docere conantur eaque
  distinguere. Cum his igitur agamus, qui haec distinguunt: illos, qui
  omnia sic incerta dicunt, ut stellarum numerus par an impar sit, quasi
  desperatos aliquos relinquamus. Volunt enim&mdash;et hoc quidem vel
  maxime vos animadvertebam moveri&mdash;probabile aliquid esse et quasi
  veri simile, eaque se uti regula et in agenda vita et in quaerendo ac
  disserendo.</p>

  <p>XI. <a name="BkII_33"></a><a href="#BkIIN_33">33</a>. Quae ista regula
  est veri et falsi, si notionem veri et falsi, propterea quod ea non
  possunt internosci, nullam habemus? Nam si habemus, interesse oportet ut
  inter rectum et pravum, sic inter verum et falsum. Si nihil interest,
  nulla regula est nec potest is, cui est visio veri falsique communis,
  ullum habere iudicium aut ullam omnino veritatis notam. Nam cum dicunt
  hoc se unum tollere, ut quicquam possit ita videri, ut non eodem modo
  falsum etiam possit videri, cetera autem concedere, faciunt pueriliter.
  Quo enim omnia iudicantur sublato reliqua se negant tollere: ut si quis
  quem oculis privaverit, dicat ea, quae cerni possent, se ei non ademisse.
  Ut enim illa oculis modo agnoscuntur, sic reliqua visis, sed propria
  veri, non communi veri et falsi nota. Quam ob rem, sive tu probabilem
  visionem sive probabilem et quae non impediatur, ut Carneades volebat,
  sive aliud quid proferes quod sequare, ad visum illud, de quo agimus,
  tibi erit revertendum. <a name="BkII_34"></a><a href="#BkIIN_34">34</a>.
  In eo autem, si erit communitas cum falso, nullum erit iudicium, quia
  proprium in communi signo notari non potest. Sin autem commune nihil
  erit, habeo quod volo: id enim quaero, quod ita mihi videatur verum, ut
  non possit item falsum videri. Simili in errore versantur, cum convicio
  veritatis coacti perspicua a perceptis volunt distinguere et conantur
  ostendere esse aliquid perspicui, verum illud quidem impressum in animo
  atque mente, neque tamen id percipi atque comprehendi posse. Quo enim
  modo perspicue dixeris album esse aliquid, cum possit accidere ut id,
  quod nigrum sit, album esse videatur? aut quo modo ista aut perspicua
  dicemus aut impressa subtiliter, cum sit incertum vere inaniterne
  moveatur? Ita neque color neque corpus nec veritas nec argumentum nec
  sensus neque perspicuum ullum relinquitur. <a name="BkII_35"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_35">35</a>. Ex hoc illud iis usu venire solet, ut, quidquid
  dixerint, a quibusdam interrogentur: 'Ergo istuc quidem percipis?' Sed
  qui ita interrogant, ab iis irridentur. Non enim urguent, ut coarguant
  neminem ulla de re posse contendere neque adseverare sine aliqua eius
  rei, quam sibi quisque placere dicit, certa et propria nota. Quod est
  igitur istuc vestrum probabile? Nam si, quod cuique occurrit et primo
  quasi adspectu probabile videtur, id confirmatur, quid eo levius? <a
  name="BkII_36"></a><a href="#BkIIN_36">36</a>. Sin ex circumspectione
  aliqua et accurata consideratione, quod visum sit, id se dicent sequi,
  tamen exitum non habebunt: primum quia iis visis, inter quae nihil
  interest, aequaliter omnibus abrogatur fides: deinde, cum dicant posse
  accidere sapienti ut, cum omnia fecerit diligentissimeque circumspexerit,
  exsistat aliquid quod et veri simile videatur et absit longissime a vero,
  ne si magnam partem quidem, ut solent dicere, ad verum ipsum aut quam
  proxime accedant, confidere sibi poterunt. Ut enim confidant, notum iis
  esse debebit insigne veri, quo obscurato et oppresso quod tandem verum
  sibi videbuntur attingere? Quid autem tam absurde dici potest quam cum
  ita locuntur: 'Est hoc quidem illius rei signum aut argumentum et ea re
  id sequor, sed fieri potest ut id, quod significatur, aut falsum sit aut
  nihil sit omnino.' Sed de perceptione hactenus. Si quis enim ea, quae

  <p>XII. <a name="BkII_37"></a><a href="#BkIIN_37">37</a>. His satis
  cognitis, quae iam explicata sunt, nunc de adsensione atque approbatione,
  quam Graeci <span lang="el" title="synkatathesin"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3B3;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>
  vocant, pauca dicemus, non quo non latus locus sit, sed paulo ante iacta
  sunt fundamenta. Nam cum vim, quae esset in sensibus, explicabamus, simul
  illud aperiebatur, comprehendi multa et percipi sensibus, quod fieri sine
  adsensione non potest. Deinde cum inter inanimum et animal hoc maxime
  intersit, quod animal agit aliquid&mdash;nihil enim agens ne cogitari
  quidem potest quale sit&mdash;, aut ei sensus adimendus est aut ea, quae
  est in nostra potestate sita, reddenda adsensio. <a name="BkII_38"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_38">38</a>. At vero animus quodam modo eripitur iis, quos
  neque sentire neque adsentiri volunt. Ut enim necesse est lancem in libra
  ponderibus impositis deprimi, sic animum perspicuis cedere. Nam quo modo
  non potest animal ullum non appetere id, quod accommodatum ad naturam
  appareat&mdash;Graeci id <span lang="el" title="oikeion"
  >&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>
  appellant&mdash;, sic non potest obiectam rem perspicuam non approbare.
  Quamquam, si illa, de quibus disputatum est, vera sunt, nihil attinet de
  adsensione omnino loqui. Qui enim quid percipit, adsentitur statim. Sed
  haec etiam secuntur, nec memoriam sine adsensione posse constare nec
  notitias rerum nec artis, idque, quod maximum est, ut sit aliquid in
  nostra potestate, in eo, qui rei nulli adsentietur, non erit. <a
  name="BkII_39"></a><a href="#BkIIN_39">39</a>. Ubi igitur virtus, si
  nihil situm est in ipsis nobis? Maxime autem absurdum vitia in ipsorum
  esse potestate neque peccare quemquam nisi adsensione: hoc idem in
  virtute non esse, cuius omnis constantia et firmitas ex iis rebus
  constat, quibus adsensa est et quas approbavit, omninoque ante videri
  aliquid quam agamus necesse est, eique, quod visum sit, adsentiatur. Qua
  re qui aut visum aut adsensum tollit, is omnem actionem tollit e
  vita.</p>

  <p>XIII. <a name="BkII_40"></a><a href="#BkIIN_40">40</a>. Nunc ea
  videamus, quae contra ab his disputari solent. Sed prius potestis totius
  eorum rationis quasi fundamenta cognoscere. Componunt igitur primum artem
  quandam de iis, quae visa dicimus, eorumque et vim et genera definiunt,
  in his, quale sit id, quod percipi et comprehendi possit, totidem verbis
  quot Stoici. Deinde illa exponunt duo, quae quasi contineant omnem hanc
  quaestionem: quae ita videantur, ut etiam alia eodem modo videri possint
  nec in iis quicquam intersit, non posse eorum alia percipi, alia non
  percipi: nihil interesse autem, non modo si omni ex parte eiusdem modi
  sint, sed etiam si discerni non possint. Quibus positis unius argumenti
  conclusione tota ab his causa comprehenditur. Composita ea conclusio sic
  est: 'Eorum, quae videntur, alia vera sunt, alia falsa, et quod falsum
  est, id percipi non potest: quod autem verum visum est, id omne tale est,
  ut eiusdem modi etiam falsum possit videri.' Et, 'quae visa sint eius
  modi, ut in iis nihil intersit, non posse accidere ut eorum alia percipi
  possint, alia non possint. <a name="BkII_41"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_41">41</a>. Nullum igitur est visum quod percipi possit.'
  Quae autem sumunt, ut concludant id, quod volunt, ex his duo sibi putant
  concedi: neque enim quisquam repugnat. Ea sunt haec: 'Quae visa falsa
  sint, ea percipi non posse,' et alterum: 'Inter quae visa nihil intersit,
  ex iis non posse alia talia esse, ut percipi possint, alia ut non
  possint:' reliqua vero multa et varia oratione defendunt, quae sunt item
  duo, unum: 'quae videantur, eorum alia vera esse, alia falsa,' alterum:
  'omne visum, quod sit a vero, tale esse, quale etiam a falso possit
  esse.' <a name="BkII_42"></a><a href="#BkIIN_42">42</a>. Haec duo
  proposita non praetervolant, sed ita dilatant, ut non mediocrem curam
  adhibeant et diligentiam. Dividunt enim in partis et eas quidem magnas:
  primum in sensus, deinde in ea, quae ducuntur a sensibus et ab omni
  consuetudine, quam obscurari volunt. Tum perveniunt ad eam partem, ut ne
  ratione quidem et coniectura ulla res percipi possit. Haec autem universa
  concidunt etiam minutius. Ut enim de sensibus hesterno sermone vidistis,
  item faciunt de reliquis, in singulisque rebus, quas in minima
  dispertiunt, volunt efficere iis omnibus, quae visa sint, veris adiuncta
  esse falsa, quae a veris nihil differant: ea cum talia sint, non posse
  comprehendi.</p>

  <p>XIV. <a name="BkII_43"></a><a href="#BkIIN_43">43</a>. Hanc ego
  subtilitatem philosophia quidem dignissimam iudico, sed ab eorum causa,
  qui ita disserunt, remotissimam. Definitiones enim et partitiones et
  horum luminibus utens oratio, tum similitudines dissimilitudinesque et
  earum tenuis et acuta distinctio fidentium est hominum illa vera et firma
  et certa esse quae tutentur, non eorum qui clament nihilo magis vera illa
  esse quam falsa. Quid enim agant, si, cum aliquid definierint, roget eos
  quispiam, num illa definitio possit in aliam rem transferri quamlubet? Si
  posse dixerint, quid dicere habeant cur illa vera definitio sit?
  si<i>n</i> negaverint, fatendum sit, quoniam vel illa vera definitio
  transferri non possit in falsum, quod ea definitione explicetur, id
  percipi posse: quod minime illi volunt. Eadem dici poterunt in omnibus
  partibus. <a name="BkII_44"></a><a href="#BkIIN_44">44</a>. Si enim
  dicent ea, de quibus disserent, se dilucide perspicere nec ulla
  communione visorum impediri, comprehendere ea se fatebuntur. Sin autem
  negabunt vera visa a falsis posse distingui, qui poterunt longius
  progredi? Occurretur enim, sicut occursum est. Nam concludi argumentum
  non potest nisi iis, quae ad concludendum sumpta erunt, ita probatis, ut
  falsa eiusdem modi nulla possint esse. Ergo si rebus comprehensis et
  perceptis nisa et progressa ratio hoc efficiet, nihil posse comprehendi,
  quid potest reperiri quod ipsum sibi repugnet magis? cumque ipsa natura
  accuratae orationis hoc profiteatur, se aliquid patefacturam quod non
  appareat et, quo id facilius adsequatur, adhibituram et sensus et ea,
  quae perspicua sint, qualis est istorum oratio, qui omnia non tam esse
  quam videri volunt? Maxime autem convincuntur, cum haec duo pro
  congruentibus sumunt tam vehementer repugnantia: primum esse quaedam
  falsa visa: quod cum volunt, declarant quaedam esse vera: deinde ibidem,
  inter falsa visa et vera nihil interesse. At primum sumpseras, tamquam
  interesset: ita priori posterius, posteriori superius non iungitur.</p>

  <p><a name="BkII_45"></a><a href="#BkIIN_45">45</a>. Sed progrediamur
  longius et ita agamus, ut nihil nobis adsentati esse videamur, quaeque ab
  iis dicuntur, sic persequamur, ut nihil in praeteritis relinquamus.
  Primum igitur perspicuitas illa, quam diximus, satis magnam habet vim, ut
  ipsa per sese ea, quae sint, nobis ita ut sint indicet. Sed tamen, ut
  maneamus in perspicuis firmius et constantius, maiore quadam opus est vel
  arte vel diligentia, ne ab iis, quae clara sint ipsa per sese, quasi
  praestigiis quibusdam et captionibus depellamur. Nam qui voluit subvenire
  erroribus Epicurus iis, qui videntur conturbare veri cognitionem,
  dixitque sapientis esse opinionem a perspicuitate seiungere, nihil
  profecit: ipsius enim opinionis errorem nullo modo sustulit.</p>

  <p>XV. <a name="BkII_46"></a><a href="#BkIIN_46">46</a>. Quam ob rem cum
  duae causae perspicuis et evidentibus rebus adversentur, auxilia totidem
  sunt contra comparanda. Adversatur enim primum, quod parum defigunt
  animos et intendunt in ea, quae perspicua sunt, ut quanta luce ea
  circumfusa sint possint agnoscere; alterum est, quod fallacibus et
  captiosis interrogationibus circumscripti atque decepti quidam, cum eas
  dissolvere non possunt, desciscunt a veritate. Oportet igitur et ea, quae
  pro perspicuitate responderi possunt, in promptu habere, de quibus iam
  diximus, et esse armatos, ut occurrere possimus interrogationibus eorum
  captionesque discutere: quod deinceps facere constitui. <a
  name="BkII_47"></a><a href="#BkIIN_47">47</a>. Exponam igitur generatim
  argumenta eorum, quoniam ipsi etiam illi solent non confuse loqui. Primum
  conantur ostendere multa posse videri esse, quae omnino nulla sint, cum
  animi inaniter moveantur eodem modo rebus iis, quae nullae sint, ut iis,
  quae sint. Nam cum dicatis, inquiunt, visa quaedam mitti a deo, velut ea,
  quae in somnis videantur quaeque oraculis, auspiciis, extis
  declarentur&mdash;haec enim aiunt probari Stoicis, quos contra
  disputant&mdash;, quaerunt quonam modo, falsa visa quae sint, ea deus
  efficere possit probabilia: quae autem plane proxime ad verum accedant,
  efficere non possit? aut, si ea quoque possit, cur illa non possit, quae
  perdifficiliter, internoscantur tamen? et, si haec, cur non inter quae
  nihil sit omnino? <a name="BkII_48"></a><a href="#BkIIN_48">48</a>.
  Deinde, cum mens moveatur ipsa per sese, ut et ea declarant, quae
  cogitatione depingimus, et ea, quae vel dormientibus vel furiosis
  videntur non numquam, veri simile est sic etiam mentem moveri, ut non
  modo non internoscat vera visa illa sint anne falsa, sed ut in iis nihil
  intersit omnino: ut si qui tremerent et exalbescerent vel ipsi per se
  motu mentis aliquo vel obiecta terribili re extrinsecus, nihil ut esset,
  qui distingueretur tremor ille et pallor, neque ut quicquam interesset
  inter intestinum et oblatum. Postremo si nulla visa sunt probabilia, quae
  falsa sint, alia ratio est. Sin autem sunt, cur non etiam quae non facile
  internoscantur? cur non ut plane nihil intersit? praesertim cum ipsi
  dicatis sapientem in furore sustinere se ab omni adsensu, quia nulla in
  visis distinctio appareat.</p>

  <p>XVI. <a name="BkII_49"></a><a href="#BkIIN_49">49</a>. Ad has omnis
  visiones inanis Antiochus quidem et permulta dicebat et erat de hac una
  re unius diei disputatio. Mihi autem non idem faciendum puto, sed ipsa
  capita dicenda. Et primum quidem hoc reprehendendum, quod captiosissimo
  genere interrogationis utuntur, quod genus minime in philosophia probari
  solet, cum aliquid minutatim et gradatim additur aut demitur. Soritas hoc
  vocant, quia acervum efficiunt uno addito grano. Vitiosum sane et
  captiosum genus! Sic enim adscenditis: Si tale visum obiectum est a deo
  dormienti, ut probabile sit, cur non etiam ut valde veri simile? cur
  deinde non ut difficiliter a vero internoscatur? deinde ut ne
  internoscatur quidem? postremo ut nihil inter hoc et illud intersit? Huc
  si perveneris, me tibi primum quidque concedente, meum vitium fuerit: sin
  ipse tua sponte processeris, tuum. <a name="BkII_50"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_50">50</a>. Quis enim tibi dederit aut omnia deum posse aut
  ita facturum esse, si possit? quo modo autem sumis, ut, si quid cui
  simile esse possit, sequatur ut etiam difficiliter internosci possit?
  deinde ut ne internosci quidem? postremo ut eadem sint? ut, si lupi
  canibus similes <i>sunt</i>, eosdem dices ad extremum. Et quidem honestis
  similia sunt quaedam non honesta et bonis non bona et artificiosis minime
  artificiosa: quid dubitamus igitur adfirmare nihil inter haec interesse?
  Ne repugnantia quidem videmus? Nihil est enim quod de suo genere in aliud
  genus transferri possit. At si efficeretur, ut inter visa differentium
  generum nihil interesset, reperirentur quae et in suo genere essent et in
  alieno. <a name="BkII_51"></a><a href="#BkIIN_51">51</a>. Quod fieri qui
  potest? Omnium deinde inanium visorum una depulsio est, sive illa
  cogitatione informantur, quod fieri solere concedimus, sive in quiete
  sive per vinum sive per insaniam. Nam ab omnibus eiusdem modi visis
  perspicuitatem, quam mordicus tenere debemus, abesse dicemus. Quis enim,
  cum sibi fingit aliquid et cogitatione depingit, non simul ac se ipse
  commovit atque ad se revocavit, sentit quid intersit inter perspicua et
  inania? Eadem ratio est somniorum. Num censes Ennium, cum in hortis cum
  Ser. Galba vicino suo ambulavisset, dixisse: 'Visus sum mihi cum Galba
  ambulare?' At, cum somniavit, ita narravit:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'visus Homerus adesse poeta.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Idemque in Epicharmo:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Nam videbar somniare med ego esse mortuum.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Itaque, simul ut experrecti sumus, visa illa contemnimus neque ita
  habemus, ut ea, quae in foro gessimus.</p>

  <p>XVII. <a name="BkII_52"></a><a href="#BkIIN_52">52</a>. At enim dum
  videntur, eadem est in somnis species eorum<i>que</i>, quae vigilantes
  videmus! Primum interest: sed id omittamus. Illud enim dicimus, non
  eandem esse vim neque integritatem dormientium et vigilantium nec mente
  nec sensu. Ne vinolenti quidem quae faciunt, eadem approbatione faciunt
  qua sobrii: dubitant, haesitant, revocant se interdum iisque, quae
  videntur, imbecillius adsentiuntur, cumque edormiverunt, illa visa quam
  levia fuerint intellegunt. Quod idem contingit insanis, ut et incipientes
  furere sentiant et dicant aliquid, quod non sit, id videri sibi, et, cum
  relaxentur, sentiant atque illa dicant Alcmaeonis:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Sed mihi ne utiquam cor consentit cum oculorum</p>
      <p>adspectu' ...</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p><a name="BkII_53"></a><a href="#BkIIN_53">53</a>. At enim ipse sapiens
  sustinet se in furore, ne approbet falsa pro veris. Et alias quidem
  saepe, si aut in sensibus ipsius est aliqua forte gravitas aut tarditas
  aut obscuriora sunt quae videntur aut a perspiciendo temporis brevitate
  excluditur. Quamquam totum hoc, sapientem aliquando sustinere
  adsensionem, contra vos est. Si enim inter visa nihil interesset, aut
  semper sustineret aut numquam. Sed ex hoc genere toto perspici potest
  levitas orationis eorum, qui omnia cupiunt confundere. Quaerimus
  gravitatis, constantiae, firmitatis, sapientiae iudicium: utimur exemplis
  somniantium, furiosorum, ebriosorum. Illud attendimus in hoc omni genere
  quam inconstanter loquamur? Non enim proferremus vino aut somno oppressos
  aut mente captos tam absurde, ut tum diceremus interesse inter
  vigilantium visa et sobriorum et sanorum et eorum, qui essent aliter
  adfecti, tum nihil interesse. <a name="BkII_54"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_54">54</a>. Ne hoc quidem cernunt, omnia se reddere incerta,
  quod nolunt, ea dico incerta, quae <span lang="el" title="adêla"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;</span> Graeci. Si enim res se ita
  habeant, ut nihil intersit, utrum ita cui videatur, ut insano, an sano,
  cui possit exploratum esse de sua sanitate? quod velle efficere non
  mediocris insaniae est. Similitudines vero aut geminorum aut signorum
  anulis impressorum pueriliter consectantur. Quis enim nostrum
  similitudines negat esse, cum eae plurimis in rebus appareant? Sed, si
  satis est ad tollendam cognitionem similia esse multa multorum, cur eo
  non estis contenti, praesertim concedentibus nobis? et cur id potius
  contenditis, quod rerum natura non patitur, ut non suo quidque genere sit
  tale, quale est, nec sit in duobus aut pluribus nulla re differens ulla
  communitas? ut [sibi] sint et ova ovorum et apes apium simillimae: quid
  pugnas igitur? aut quid tibi vis in geminis? Conceditur enim similis
  esse, quo contentus esse potueras: tu autem vis eosdem plane esse, non
  similis: quod fieri nullo modo potest. <a name="BkII_55"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_55">55</a>. Dein confugis ad physicos eos, qui maxime in
  Academia irridentur, a quibus ne tu quidem iam te abstinebis, et ais
  Democritum dicere innumerabilis esse mundos et quidem sic quosdam inter
  sese non solum similis, sed undique perfecte et absolute ita pares, ut
  inter eos nihil prorsus intersit [et eos quidem innumerabiles], itemque
  homines. Deinde postulas, ut, si mundus ita sit par alteri mundo, ut
  inter eos ne minimum quidem intersit, concedatur tibi ut in hoc quoque
  nostro mundo aliquid alicui sic sit par, ut nihil differat, nihil
  intersit. Cur enim, inquies, ex illis individuis, unde omnia Democritus
  gigni adfirmat, in reliquis mundis et in iis quidem innumerabilibus
  innumerabiles Q. Lutatii Catuli non modo possint esse, sed etiam sint, in
  hoc tanto mundo Catulus alter non possit effici?</p>

  <p>XVIII. <a name="BkII_56"></a><a href="#BkIIN_56">56</a>. Primum quidem
  me ad Democritum vocas, cui non adsentior potiusque refello propter id,
  quod dilucide docetur a politioribus physicis singularum rerum singulas
  proprietates esse. Fac enim antiquos illos Servilios, qui gemini fuerunt,
  tam similis quam dicuntur, num censes etiam eosdem fuisse? Non
  cognoscebantur foris, at domi: non ab alienis, at a suis. An non videmus
  hoc usu venire, ut, quos numquam putassemus a nobis internosci posse, eos
  consuetudine adhibita tam facile internosceremus, uti ne minimum quidem
  similes viderentur? <a name="BkII_57"></a><a href="#BkIIN_57">57</a>.
  Hic, pugnes licet, non repugnabo: quin etiam concedam illum ipsum
  sapientem, de quo omnis hic sermo est, cum ei res similes occurrant, quas
  non habeat dinotatas, retenturum adsensum nec umquam ulli viso
  adsensurum, nisi quod tale fuerit, quale falsum esse non possit. Sed et
  ad ceteras res habet quandam artem, qua vera a falsis possit distinguere,
  et ad similitudines istas usus adhibendus est. Ut mater geminos
  internoscit consuetudine oculorum, sic tu internosces, si adsueveris.
  Videsne ut in proverbio sit ovorum inter se similitudo? Tamen hoc
  accepimus, Deli fuisse compluris salvis rebus illis, qui gallinas alere
  permultas quaestus causa solerent: ii cum ovum inspexerant, quae id
  gallina peperisset dicere solebant. <a name="BkII_58"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_58">58</a>. Neque id est contra nos: nam nobis satis est ova
  illa non internoscere: nihil enim magis adsentiri par est, hoc illud
  esse, quasi inter illa omnino nihil interesset: habeo enim regulam, ut
  talia visa vera iudicem, qualia falsa esse non possint: ab hac mihi non
  licet transversum, ut aiunt, digitum discedere, ne confundam omnia. Veri
  enim et falsi non modo cognitio, sed etiam natura tolletur, si nihil erit
  quod intersit: ut etiam illud absurdum sit, quod interdum soletis dicere,
  cum visa in animos imprimantur, non vos id dicere, inter ipsas
  impressiones nihil interesse, sed inter species et quasdam formas eorum.
  Quasi vero non specie visa iudicentur! quae fidem nullam habebunt sublata
  veri et falsi nota. <a name="BkII_59"></a><a href="#BkIIN_59">59</a>.
  Illud vero perabsurdum, quod dicitis, probabilia vos sequi, si re nulla
  impediamini. Primum qui potestis non impediri, cum a veris falsa non
  distent? deinde quod iudicium est veri, cum sit commune falsi? Ex his
  illa necessario nata est <span lang="el" title="epochê"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C7;&#x3B7;</span>, id est adsensionis retentio,
  in qua melius sibi constitit Arcesilas, si vera sunt quae de Carneade non
  nulli existimant. Si enim percipi nihil potest, quod utrique visum est,
  tollendus adsensus est. Quid enim est tam futile quam quicquam approbare
  non cognitum? Carneadem autem etiam heri audiebamus solitum esse
  <i>eo</i> delabi interdum, ut diceret opinaturum, id est peccaturum esse
  sapientem. Mihi porro non tam certum est esse aliquid, quod comprehendi
  possit, de quo iam nimium etiam diu disputo, quam sapientem nihil
  opinari, id est, numquam adsentiri rei vel falsae vel incognitae. <a
  name="BkII_60"></a><a href="#BkIIN_60">60</a>. Restat illud, quod dicunt,
  veri inveniendi causa contra omnia dici oportere et pro omnibus. Volo
  igitur videre quid invenerint. Non solemus, inquit, ostendere. Quae sunt
  tandem ista mysteria? aut cur celatis, quasi turpe aliquid, sententiam
  vestram? Ut, qui audient, inquit, ratione potius quam auctoritate
  ducantur. Quid, si utroque? num peius est? Unum tamen illud non celant,
  nihil esse quod percipi possit. An in eo auctoritas nihil obest? Mihi
  quidem videtur vel plurimum. Quis enim ista tam aperte perspicueque et
  perversa et falsa secutus esset, nisi tanta in Arcesila, multo etiam
  maior in Carneade et copia rerum et dicendi vis fuisset?</p>

  <p>XIX. <a name="BkII_61"></a><a href="#BkIIN_61">61</a>. Haec Antiochus
  fere et Alexandreae tum et multis annis post, multo etiam adseverantius,
  in Syria cum esset mecum, paulo ante quam est mortuus. Sed iam confirmata
  causa te, hominem amicissimum&mdash;me autem appellabat&mdash;et aliquot
  annis minorem natu, non dubitabo monere: Tune, cum tantis laudibus
  philosophiam extuleris Hortensiumque nostrum dissentientem commoveris,
  eam philosophiam sequere quae confundit vera cum falsis, spoliat nos
  iudicio, privat approbatione, omnibus orbat sensibus? Et Cimmeriis
  quidem, quibus adspectum solis sive deus aliquis sive natura ademerat
  sive eius loci, quem incolebant, situs, ignes tamen aderant, quorum illis
  uti lumine licebat, isti autem, quos tu probas, tantis offusis tenebris
  ne scintillam quidem ullam nobis ad dispiciendum reliquerunt: quos si
  sequamur, iis vinculis simus adstricti, ut nos commovere nequeamus. <a
  name="BkII_62"></a><a href="#BkIIN_62">62</a>. Sublata enim adsensione
  omnem et motum animorum et actionem rerum sustulerunt: quod non modo
  recte fieri, sed omnino fieri non potest. Provide etiam ne uni tibi istam
  sententiam minime liceat defendere. An tu, cum res occultissimas
  aperueris in lucemque protuleris iuratusque dixeris ea te comperisse,
  quod mihi quoque licebat, qui ex te illa cognoveram, negabis esse rem
  ullam quae cognosci, comprehendi, percipi possit? Vide, quaeso, etiam
  atque etiam ne illarum quoque rerum pulcherrimarum a te ipso minuatur
  auctoritas. Quae cum dixisset ille, finem fecit. <a name="BkII_63"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_63">63</a>. Hortensius autem vehementer admirans, quod
  quidem perpetuo Lucullo loquente fecerat, ut etiam manus saepe tolleret,
  nec mirum: nam numquam arbitror contra Academiam dictum esse subtilius,
  me quoque, iocansne an ita sentiens&mdash;non enim satis
  intellegebam&mdash;, coepit hortari, ut sententia desisterem. Tum mihi
  Catulus: Si te, inquit, Luculli oratio flexit, quae est habita memoriter,
  accurate, copiose, taceo neque te quo minus, si tibi ita videatur,
  sententiam mutes deterrendum puto. Illud vero non censuerim, ut eius
  auctoritate moveare. Tantum enim non te modo monuit, inquit adridens, ut
  caveres ne quis improbus tribunus plebis, quorum vides quanta copia
  semper futura sit, adriperet te et in contione quaereret qui tibi
  constares, cum idem negares quicquam certi posse reperiri, idem te
  comperisse dixisses. Hoc, quaeso, cave ne te terreat. De causa autem ipsa
  malim quidem te ab hoc dissentire. Sin cesseris, non magno opere mirabor.
  Memini enim Antiochum ipsum, cum annos multos alia sensisset, simul ac
  visum sit, sententia destitisse. Haec cum dixisset Catulus, me omnes
  intueri.</p>

  <p>XX. <a name="BkII_64"></a><a href="#BkIIN_64">64</a>. Tum ego non
  minus commotus quam soleo in causis maioribus, huius modi quadam oratione
  sum exorsus: Me, Catule, oratio Luculli de ipsa re ita movit, ut docti
  hominis et copiosi et parati et nihil praetereuntis eorum, quae pro illa
  causa dici possent, non tamen ut ei respondere posse diffiderem.
  Auctoritas autem tanta plane me movebat, nisi tu opposuisses non minorem
  tuam. Adgrediar igitur, si pauca ante quasi de fama mea dixero. <a
  name="BkII_65"></a><a href="#BkIIN_65">65</a>. Ego enim si aut
  ostentatione aliqua adductus aut studio certandi ad hanc potissimum
  philosophiam me applicavi, non modo stultitiam meam, sed etiam mores et
  naturam condemnandam puto. Nam, si in minimis rebus pertinacia
  reprehenditur, calumnia etiam coercetur, ego de omni statu consilioque
  totius vitae aut certare cum aliis pugnaciter aut frustrari cum alios tum
  etiam me ipsum velim? Itaque, nisi ineptum putarem in tali disputatione
  id facere, quod, cum de re publica disceptatur, fieri interdum solet,
  iurarem per Iovem deosque penates me et ardere studio veri reperiendi et
  ea sentire, quae dicerem. <a name="BkII_66"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_66">66</a>. Qui enim possum non cupere verum invenire, cum
  gaudeam, si simile veri quid invenerim? Sed, ut hoc pulcherrimum esse
  iudico, vera videre, sic pro veris probare falsa turpissimum est. Nec
  tamen ego is sum, qui nihil umquam falsi approbem, qui numquam adsentiar,
  qui nihil opiner, sed quaerimus de sapiente. Ego vero ipse et magnus
  quidem sum opinator&mdash;non enim sum sapiens&mdash;et meas cogitationes
  sic dirigo, non ad illam parvulam Cynosuram,</p>

  <p>sed Helicen et clarissimos Septemtriones, id est, rationes has latiore
  specie, non ad tenue elimatas. Eo fit ut errem et vager latius. Sed non
  de me, ut dixi, sed de sapiente quaeritur. Visa enim ista cum acriter
  mentem sensumve pepulerunt, accipio iisque interdum etiam adsentior, nec
  percipio tamen; nihil enim arbitror posse percipi. Non sum sapiens;
  itaque visis cedo nec possum resistere. Sapientis autem hanc censet
  Arcesilas vim esse maximam, Zenoni adsentiens, cavere ne capiatur, ne
  fallatur videre. Nihil est enim ab ea cogitatione, quam habemus de
  gravitate sapientis, errore, levitate, temeritate diiunctius. Quid igitur
  loquar de firmitate sapientis? quem quidem nihil opinari tu quoque,
  Luculle, concedis. Quod quoniam a te probatur&mdash;ut praepostere tecum
  agam, mox referam me ad ordinem&mdash;haec primum conclusio quam habeat
  vim considera.</p>

  <p>XXI. <a name="BkII_67"></a><a href="#BkIIN_67">67</a>. Si ulli rei
  sapiens adsentietur umquam, aliquando etiam opinabitur: numquam autem
  opinabitur: nulli igitur rei adsentietur. Hanc conclusionem Arcesilas
  probabat: confirmabat enim et primum et secundum. Carneades non numquam
  secundum illud dabat: adsentiri aliquando. Ita sequebatur etiam opinari,
  quod tu non vis et recte, ut mihi videris. Sed illud primum, sapientem,
  si adsensurus esset, etiam opinaturum, falsum esse et Stoici dicunt et
  eorum adstipulator Antiochus: posse enim eum falsa a veris et quae non
  possint percipi ab iis, quae possint, distinguere. <a
  name="BkII_68"></a><a href="#BkIIN_68">68</a>. Nobis autem primum, etiam
  si quid percipi possit, tamen ipsa consuetudo adsentiendi periculosa esse
  videtur et lubrica. Quam ob rem cum tam vitiosum esse constet adsentiri
  quicquam aut falsum aut incognitum, sustinenda est potius omnis adsensio,
  ne praecipitet, si temere processerit. Ita enim finitima sunt falsa
  veris, eaque, quae percipi non possunt, <i>iis quae possunt</i>&mdash;si
  modo ea sunt quaedam: iam enim videbimus&mdash;, ut tam in praecipitem
  locum non debeat se sapiens committere. Sin autem omnino nihil esse quod
  percipi possit a me sumpsero et, quod tu mihi das, accepero, sapientem
  nihil opinari, effectum illud erit, sapientem adsensus omnes cohibiturum,
  ut videndum tibi sit, idne malis an aliquid opinaturum esse sapientem.
  Neutrum, inquies, illorum. Nitamur igitur, nihil posse percipi: etenim de
  eo omnis est controversia.</p>

  <p>XXII. <a name="BkII_69"></a><a href="#BkIIN_69">69</a>. Sed prius
  pauca cum Antiocho, qui haec ipsa, quae a me defenduntur, et didicit apud
  Philonem tam diu, ut constaret diutius didicisse neminem, et scripsit de
  his rebus acutissime, et idem haec non acrius accusavit in senectute quam
  antea defensitaverat. Quamvis igitur fuerit acutus, ut fuit, tamen
  inconstantia levatur auctoritas. Quis enim iste dies illuxerit quaero,
  qui illi ostenderit eam, quam multos annos esse negitavisset, veri et
  falsi notam. Excogitavit aliquid? Eadem dicit quae Stoici. Poenituit illa
  sensisse? Cur non se transtulit ad alios et maxime ad Stoicos? eorum enim
  erat propria ista dissensio. Quid? eum Mnesarchi poenitebat? quid?
  Dardani? qui erant Athenis tum principes Stoicorum. Numquam a Philone
  discessit, nisi postea quam ipse coepit qui se audirent habere. <a
  name="BkII_70"></a><a href="#BkIIN_70">70</a>. Unde autem subito vetus
  Academia revocata est? Nominis dignitatem videtur, cum a re ipsa
  descisceret, retinere voluisse, quod erant qui illum gloriae causa facere
  dicerent, sperare etiam fore ut ii, qui se sequerentur, Antiochii
  vocarentur. Mihi autem magis videtur non potuisse sustinere concursum
  omnium philosophorum. Etenim de ceteris sunt inter illos non nulla
  communia: haec Academicorum est una sententia, quam reliquorum
  philosophorum nemo probet. Itaque cessit, et ut ii, qui sub Novis solem
  non ferunt, item ille, cum aestuaret, veterum, ut Maenianorum, sic
  Academicorum umbram secutus est. <a name="BkII_71"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_71">71</a>. Quoque solebat uti argumento tum, cum ei
  placebat nihil posse percipi, cum quaereret, Dionysius ille Heracleotes
  utrum comprehendisset certa illa nota, qua adsentiri dicitis oportere,
  illudne, quod multos annos tenuisset Zenonique magistro credidisset,
  honestum quod esset, id bonum solum esse, an quod postea defensitavisset,
  honesti inane nomen esse, voluptatem esse summum bonum: qui ex illius
  commutata sententia docere vellet nihil ita signari in animis nostris a
  vero posse, quod non eodem modo possit a falso, is curavit <i>ut</i> quod
  argumentum ex Dionysio ipse sumpsisset, ex eo ceteri sumerent. Sed cum
  hoc alio loco plura, nunc ad ea, quae a te, Luculle, dicta sunt.</p>

  <p>XXIII. <a name="BkII_72"></a><a href="#BkIIN_72">72</a>. Et primum
  quod initio dixisti videamus quale sit: similiter a nobis de antiquis
  philosophis commemorari atque seditiosi solerent claros viros, sed tamen
  popularis aliquos nominare. Illi cum res <i>non</i> bonas tractent,
  similes bonorum videri volunt. Nos autem dicimus ea nobis videri, quae
  vosmet ipsi nobilissimis philosophis placuisse conceditis. Anaxagoras
  nivem nigram dixit esse. Ferres me, si ego idem dicerem? Tu, ne si
  dubitarem quidem. At quis est? num hic sophistes?&mdash;sic enim
  appellabantur ii, qui ostentationis aut quaestus causa
  philosophabantur&mdash;: maxima fuit et gravitatis et ingeni gloria. <a
  name="BkII_73"></a><a href="#BkIIN_73">73</a>. Quid loquar de Democrito?
  Quem cum eo conferre possumus non modo ingeni magnitudine, sed etiam
  animi? qui ita sit ausus ordiri: 'Haec loquor de universis.' Nihil
  excipit de quo non profiteatur. Quid enim esse potest extra universa?
  quis hunc philosophum non anteponit Cleanthi, Chrysippo, reliquis
  inferioris aetatis? qui mihi cum illo collati quintae classis videntur.
  Atque is non hoc dicit, quod nos, qui veri esse aliquid non negamus,
  percipi posse negamus; ille verum plane negat esse: sensus quidem non
  obscuros dicit, sed tenebricosos: sic enim appellat [eos]. Is, qui hunc
  maxime est admiratus, Chius Metrodorus initio libri, qui est de natura:
  'Nego,' inquit, 'scire nos sciamusne aliquid an nihil sciamus, ne id
  ipsum quidem, nescire aut scire, scire nos, nec omnino sitne aliquid an
  nihil sit.' <a name="BkII_74"></a><a href="#BkIIN_74">74</a>. Furere tibi
  Empedocles videtur: at mihi dignissimum rebus iis, de quibus loquitur,
  sonum fundere. Num ergo is excaecat nos aut orbat sensibus, si parum
  magnam vim censet in iis esse ad ea, quae sub eos subiecta sunt,
  iudicanda? Parmenides, Xenophanes, minus bonis quamquam versibus, sed
  tamen illi versibus increpant eorum adrogantiam quasi irati, qui, cum
  sciri nihil possit, audeant se scire dicere. Et ab iis aiebas removendum
  Socratem et Platonem. Cur? an de ullis certius possum dicere? Vixisse cum
  iis equidem videor: ita multi sermones perscripti sunt, e quibus dubitari
  non possit quin Socrati nihil sit visum sciri posse. Excepit unum tantum,
  'scire se nihil se scire,' nihil amplius. Quid dicam de Platone? qui
  certe tam multis libris haec persecutus non esset, nisi probavisset.
  Ironiam enim alterius, perpetuam praesertim, nulla fuit ratio
  persequi.</p>

  <p>XXIV. <a name="BkII_75"></a><a href="#BkIIN_75">75</a>. Videorne tibi,
  non ut Saturninus, nominare modo illustris homines, sed imitari numquam
  nisi clarum, nisi nobilem? Atqui habebam molestos vobis, sed minutos,
  Stilponem, Diodorum, Alexinum, quorum sunt contorta et aculeata quaedam
  <span lang="el" title="sophismata"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>;
  sic enim appellantur fallaces conclusiunculae. Sed quid eos colligam, cum
  habeam Chrysippum, qui fulcire putatur porticum Stoicorum? Quam multa
  ille contra sensus, quam multa contra omnia, quae in consuetudine
  probantur! At dissolvit idem. Mihi quidem non videtur: sed dissolverit
  sane. Certe tam multa non collegisset, quae nos fallerent probabilitate
  magna, nisi videret iis resisti non facile posse. <a
  name="BkII_76"></a><a href="#BkIIN_76">76</a>. Quid Cyrenaici <i>tibi</i>
  videntur, minime contempti philosophi? Qui negant esse quicquam quod
  percipi possit extrinsecus: ea se sola percipere, quae tactu intimo
  sentiant, ut dolorem, ut voluptatem: neque se quo quid colore aut quo
  sono sit scire, sed tantum sentire adfici se quodam modo.</p>

  <p>Satis multa de auctoribus. Quamquam ex me quaesieras nonne putarem
  post illos veteres tot saeculis inveniri verum potuisse tot ingeniis
  tantisque studiis quaerentibus. Quid inventum sit paulo post videro, te
  ipso quidem iudice. Arcesilam vero non obtrectandi causa cum Zenone
  pugnavisse, sed verum invenire voluisse sic intellegitur. <a
  name="BkII_77"></a><a href="#BkIIN_77">77</a>. Nemo, inquam, superiorum
  non modo expresserat, sed ne dixerat quidem posse hominem nihil opinari,
  nec solum posse, sed ita necesse esse sapienti. Visa est Arcesilae cum
  vera sententia tum honesta et digna sapiente. Quaesivit de Zenone
  fortasse quid futurum esset, si nec percipere quicquam posset sapiens nec
  opinari sapientis esset. Ille, credo, nihil opinaturum, quoniam esset,
  quod percipi posset. Quid ergo id esset? Visum, credo. Quale igitur
  visum? tum illum ita definisse, ex eo, quod esset, sicut esset, impressum
  et signatum et effictum. Post requisitum etiamne, si eiusdem modi esset
  visum verum, quale vel falsum. Hic Zenonem vidisse acute nullum esse
  visum quod percipi posset, si id tale esset ab eo, quod est, ut eiusdem
  modi ab eo, quod non est, posset esse. Recte consensit Arcesilas; ad
  definitionem additum: neque enim falsum percipi posse neque verum, si
  esset tale, quale vel falsum. Incubuit autem in eas disputationes, ut
  doceret nullum tale esse visum a vero, ut non eiusdem modi etiam a falso
  possit esse. <a name="BkII_78"></a><a href="#BkIIN_78">78</a>. Haec est
  una contentio, quae adhuc permanserit. Nam illud, nulli rei adsensurum
  esse sapientem, nihil ad hanc controversiam pertinebat. Licebat enim
  nihil percipere et tamen opinari, quod a Carneade dicitur probatum:
  equidem Clitomacho plus quam Philoni aut Metrodoro credens, hoc magis ab
  eo disputatum quam probatum puto. Sed id omittamus. Illud certe
  opinatione et perceptione sublata sequitur, omnium adsensionum retentio,
  ut, si ostendero nihil posse percipi, tu concedas numquam adsensurum
  esse.</p>

  <p>XXV. <a name="BkII_79"></a><a href="#BkIIN_79">79</a>. Quid ergo est
  quod percipi possit, si ne sensus quidem vera nuntiant? quos tu, Luculle,
  communi loco defendis: quod ne [id] facere posses, idcirco heri non
  necessario loco contra sensus tam multa dixeram. Tu autem te negas
  infracto remo neque columbae collo commoveri. Primum cur? Nam et in remo
  sentio non esse id, quod videatur, et in columba pluris videri colores
  nec esse plus uno. Deinde nihilne praeterea diximus?&mdash;Manent illa
  omnia, iacet ista causa: veracis suos esse sensus dicit.&mdash;Igitur
  semper auctorem habes eum, qui magno suo periculo causam agat! Eo enim
  rem demittit Epicurus, si unus sensus semel in vita mentitus sit, nulli
  umquam esse credendum. <a name="BkII_80"></a><a href="#BkIIN_80">80</a>.
  Hoc est verum esse, confidere suis testibus et importune insistere!
  Itaque Timagoras Epicureus negat sibi umquam, cum oculum torsisset, duas
  ex lucerna flammulas esse visas: opinionis enim esse mendacium, non
  oculorum. Quasi quaeratur quid sit, non quid videatur. Sed hic quidem
  maiorum similis: tu vero, qui visa sensibus alia vera dicas esse, alia
  falsa, qui ea distinguis? Desine, quaeso, communibus locis: domi nobis
  ista nascuntur. Si, inquis, deus te interroget: Sanis modo et integris
  sensibus, num amplius quid desideras? quid respondeas?&mdash;Utinam
  quidem roget? Audiret quam nobiscum male ageret. Ut enim vera videamus,
  quam longe videmus? Ego Catuli Cumanum ex hoc loco video, Pompeianum non
  cerno, neque quicquam interiectum est quod obstet, sed intendi acies
  longius non potest. O praeclarum prospectum! Puteolos videmus: at
  familiarem nostrum C. Avianium, fortasse in porticu Neptuni ambulantem,
  non videmus. <a name="BkII_81"></a><a href="#BkIIN_81">81</a>. At ille
  nescio qui, qui in scholis nominari solet, mille et octingenta stadia
  quod abesset videbat: quaedam volucres longius. Responderem igitur
  audacter isti vestro deo me plane his oculis non esse contentum. Dicet me
  acrius videre quam illos pisces fortasse qui neque videntur a nobis et
  nunc quidem sub oculis sunt neque ipsi nos suspicere possunt. Ergo ut
  illis aqua, sic nobis aër crassus offunditur. At amplius non desideramus.
  Quid? talpam num desiderare lumen putas? Neque tam quererer cum deo, quod
  parum longe quam quod falsum viderem. Videsne navem illam? Stare nobis
  videtur: at iis, qui in nave sunt, moveri haec villa. Quaere rationem cur
  ita videatur: quam ut maxime inveneris, quod haud scio an non possis, non
  tu verum testem habere, sed eum non sine causa falsum testimonium dicere
  ostenderis.</p>

  <p>XXVI. <a name="BkII_82"></a><a href="#BkIIN_82">82</a>. Quid ego de
  nave? Vidi enim a te remum contemni. Maiora fortasse quaeris. Quid potest
  esse sole maius? quem mathematici amplius duodeviginti partibus
  confirmant maiorem esse quam terram. Quantulus nobis videtur! Mihi quidem
  quasi pedalis. Epicurus autem posse putat etiam minorem esse eum quam
  videatur, sed non multo: ne maiorem quidem multo putat esse vel tantum
  esse, quantus videatur, ut oculi aut nihil mentiantur aut non multum. Ubi
  igitur illud est semel? Sed ab hoc credulo, qui numquam sensus mentiri
  putat, discedamus: qui ne nunc quidem, cum ille sol, qui tanta
  incitatione fertur, ut celeritas eius quanta sit ne cogitari quidem
  possit, tamen nobis stare videatur. <a name="BkII_83"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_83">83</a>. Sed, ut minuam controversiam, videte, quaeso,
  quam in parvo lis sit. Quattuor sunt capita, quae concludant nihil esse
  quod nosci, percipi, comprehendi possit, de quo haec tota quaestio est. E
  quibus primum est esse aliquod visum falsum, secundum non posse id
  percipi, tertium, inter quae visa nihil intersit, fieri non posse ut
  eorum alia percipi possint, alia non possint, quartum nullum esse visum
  verum a sensu profectum, cui non appositum sit visum aliud, quod ab eo
  nihil intersit quodque percipi non possit. Horum quattuor capitum
  secundum et tertium omnes concedunt. Primum Epicurus non dat; vos,
  quibuscum res est, id quoque conceditis. Omnis pugna de quarto est. <a
  name="BkII_84"></a><a href="#BkIIN_84">84</a>. Qui igitur P. Servilium
  Geminum videbat, si Quintum se videre putabat, incidebat in eius modi
  visum, quod percipi non posset, quia nulla nota verum distinguebatur a
  falso: qua distinctione sublata quam haberet in C. Cotta, qui bis cum
  Gemino consul fuit, agnoscendo eius modi notam, quae falsa esse non
  posset? Negas tantam similitudinem in rerum natura esse. Pugnas omnino,
  sed cum adversario facili. Ne sit sane: videri certe potest. Fallet
  igitur sensum, et si una fefellerit similitudo, dubia omnia reddiderit.
  Sublato enim iudicio illo, quo oportet agnosci, etiam si ipse erit, quem
  videris, qui tibi videbitur, tamen non ea nota iudicabis, qua dicis
  oportere, ut non possit esse eiusdem modi falsa. <a name="BkII_85"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_85">85</a>. Quando igitur potest tibi P. Geminus Quintus
  videri, quid habes explorati cur non possit tibi Cotta videri qui non
  sit, quoniam aliquid videtur esse, quod non est? Omnia dicis sui generis
  esse, nihil esse idem, quod sit aliud. Stoicum est quidem nec admodum
  credibile 'nullum esse pilum omnibus rebus talem, qualis sit pilus alius,
  nullum granum.' Haec refelli possunt, sed pugnare nolo. Ad id enim, quod
  agitur, nihil interest omnibusne partibus visa res nihil differat an
  internosci non possit, etiam si differat. Sed, si hominum similitudo
  tanta esse non potest, ne signorum quidem? Dic mihi, Lysippus eodem aere,
  eadem temperatione, eodem caelo atque ceteris omnibus, centum Alexandros
  eiusdem modi facere non posset? Qua igitur notione discerneres? <a
  name="BkII_86"></a><a href="#BkIIN_86">86</a>. Quid? si in eius<i>dem</i>
  modi cera centum sigilla hoc anulo impressero, ecquae poterit in
  agnoscendo esse distinctio? an tibi erit quaerendus anularius aliqui,
  quoniam gallinarium invenisti Deliacum illum, qui ova cognosceret?</p>

  <p>XXVII. Sed adhibes artem advocatam etiam sensibus. Pictor videt quae
  nos non videmus et, simul inflavit tibicen, a perito carmen agnoscitur.
  Quid? hoc nonne videtur contra te valere, si sine magnis artificiis, ad
  quae pauci accedunt, nostri quidem generis admodum, nec videre nec audire
  possimus? Iam illa praeclara, quanto artificio esset sensus nostros
  mentemque et totam constructionem hominis fabricata natura! <a
  name="BkII_87"></a><a href="#BkIIN_87">87</a>. Cur non extimescam
  opinandi temeritatem? Etiamne hoc adfirmare potes, Luculle, esse aliquam
  vim, cum prudentia et consilio scilicet, quae finxerit vel, ut tuo verbo
  utar, quae fabricata sit hominem? Qualis ista fabrica est? ubi adhibita?
  quando? cur? quo modo? Tractantur ista ingeniose: disputantur etiam
  eleganter. Denique videantur sane, ne adfirmentur modo. Sed de physicis
  mox et quidem ob eam causam, ne tu, qui idem me facturum paulo ante
  dixeris, videare mentitus. Sed ut ad ea, quae clariora sunt, veniam, res
  iam universas profundam, de quibus volumina impleta sunt non a nostris
  solum, sed etiam a Chrysippo:&mdash;de quo queri solent Stoici, dum
  studiose omnia conquisierit contra sensus et perspicuitatem contraque
  omnem consuetudinem contraque rationem, ipsum sibi respondentem
  inferiorem fuisse, itaque ab eo armatum esse Carneadem.&mdash;<a
  name="BkII_88"></a><a href="#BkIIN_88">88</a>. Ea sunt eius modi, quae a
  te diligentissime tractata sunt. Dormientium et vinolentorum et
  furiosorum visa imbecilliora esse dicebas quam vigilantium, siccorum,
  sanorum. Quo modo? quia, cum experrectus esset Ennius, non diceret 'se
  vidisse Homerum, sed visum esse,' Alcmaeo autem:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Sed mihi ne utiquam cor consentit ...'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Similia de vinolentis. Quasi quisquam neget et qui experrectus sit,
  eum somnia re<i>ri</i> et cuius furor consederit, putare non fuisse ea
  vera, quae essent sibi visa in furore. Sed non id agitur: tum, cum
  videbantur, quo modo viderentur, id quaeritur. Nisi vero Ennium non
  putamus ita totum illud audivisse,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'O pietas animi ...',</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>si modo id somniavit, ut si vigilans audiret. Experrectus enim potuit
  illa visa putare, ut erant, somnia: dormienti vero aeque ac vigilanti
  probabantur. Quid? Iliona somno illo:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Mater, te appello ...'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>nonne ita credit filium locutum, ut experrecta etiam crederet? Unde
  enim illa:</p>

  <p>'Age adsta: mane, audi: iterandum eadem istaec mihi!' num videtur
  minorem habere visis quam vigilantes fidem?</p>

  <p>XXVIII. <a name="BkII_89"></a><a href="#BkIIN_89">89</a>. Quid loquar
  de insanis? qualis tandem fuit adfinis tuus, Catule, Tuditanus? quisquam
  sanissimus tam certa putat quae videt quam is putabat quae videbantur?
  Quid ille, qui:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Video, video te. Vive, Ulixes, dum licet,'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>nonne etiam bis exclamavit se videre, cum omnino non videret? Quid?
  apud Euripidem Hercules, cum, ut Eurysthei filios, ita suos configebat
  sagittis, cum uxorem interemebat, cum conabatur etiam patrem, non perinde
  movebatur falsis, ut veris moveretur? Quid? ipse Alcmaeo tuus, qui negat
  'cor sibi cum oculis consentire,' nonne ibidem incitato furore:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'unde haec flamma oritur?'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>et illa deinceps:</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Incedunt, incedunt: adsunt, <i>adsunt</i>, me expetunt:'</p>
    </div>

  <p>Quid? cum virginis fidem implorat:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Fer mi auxilium, pestem abige a me, flammiferam</p>
      <p class="i4">hanc vim, quae me excruciat!</p>
      <p>Caerulea incinctae angui incedunt, circumstant</p>
      <p class="i4">cum ardentibus taedis.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Num dubitas quin sibi haec videre videatur? Itemque cetera:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>'Intendit crinitus Apollo</p>
      <p>arcum auratum, luna innixus:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p><a name="BkII_90"></a><a href="#BkIIN_90">90</a>. Qui magis haec
  crederet, si essent, quam credebat, quia videbantur? Apparet enim iam
  'cor cum oculis consentire.' Omnia autem haec proferuntur, ut illud
  efficiatur, quo certius nihil potest esse, inter visa vera et falsa ad
  animi adsensum nihil interesse. Vos autem nihil agitis, cum illa falsa
  vel furiosorum vel somniantium recordatione ipsorum refellitis. Non enim
  id quaeritur, qualis recordatio fieri soleat eorum, qui experrecti sint,
  aut eorum, qui furere destiterint, sed qualis visio fuerit aut furentium
  aut somniantium tum cum movebantur. Sed abeo a sensibus.</p>

  <p><a name="BkII_91"></a><a href="#BkIIN_91">91</a>. Quid est quod
  ratione percipi possit? Dialecticam inventam esse dicitis, veri et falsi
  quasi disceptatricem et iudicem. Cuius veri et falsi? et in qua re? In
  geometriane quid sit verum aut falsum dialecticus iudicabit an in
  litteris an in musicis? At ea non novit. In philosophia igitur. Sol
  quantus sit quid ad illum? Quod sit summum bonum quid habet ut queat
  iudicare? Quid igitur iudicabit? quae coniunctio, quae diiunctio vera
  sit, quid ambigue dictum sit, quid sequatur quamque rem, quid repugnet?
  Si haec et horum similia iudicat, de se ipsa iudicat. Plus autem
  pollicebatur. Nam haec quidem iudicare ad ceteras res, quae sunt in
  philosophia multae atque magnae, non est satis. <a name="BkII_92"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_92">92</a>. Sed quoniam tantum in ea arte ponitis, videte ne
  contra vos tota nata sit: quae primo progressu festive tradit elementa
  loquendi et ambiguorum intellegentiam concludendique rationem, tum paucis
  additis venit ad soritas, lubricum sane et periculosum locum, quod tu
  modo dicebas esse vitiosum interrogandi genus.</p>

  <p>XXIX. Quid ergo? istius vitii num nostra culpa est? Rerum natura
  nullam nobis dedit cognitionem finium, ut ulla in re statuere possimus
  quatenus. Nec hoc in acervo tritici solum, unde nomen est, sed nulla
  omnino in re minutatim interrogati, dives pauper, clarus obscurus sit,
  multa pauca, magna parva, longa brevia, lata angusta, quanto aut addito
  aut dempto certum respondeamus [non] habemus.&mdash;<a
  name="BkII_93"></a><a href="#BkIIN_93">93</a>. At vitiosi sunt
  soritae.&mdash;Frangite igitur eos, si potestis, ne molesti sint. Erunt
  enim, nisi cavetis. Cautum est, inquit. Placet enim Chrysippo, cum
  gradatim interrogetur, verbi causa, tria pauca sint anne multa, aliquanto
  prius quam ad multa perveniat quiescere, id est, quod ab his dicitur,
  <span lang="el" title="hêsychazein"
  >&#x201B;&#x3B7;&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3C7;&#x3B1;&#x3B6;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>.
  Per me vel stertas licet, inquit Carneades, non modo quiescas. Sed quid
  proficit? Sequitur enim, qui te ex somno excitet et eodem modo
  interroget. Quo in numero conticuisti, si ad eum numerum unum addidero,
  multane erunt? Progrediere rursus, quoad videbitur. Quid plura? hoc enim
  fateris, neque ultimum te paucorum neque primum multorum respondere
  posse. Cuius generis error ita manat, ut non videam quo non possit
  accedere. <a name="BkII_94"></a><a href="#BkIIN_94">94</a>. Nihil me
  laedit, inquit: ego enim, ut agitator callidus, prius quam ad finem
  veniam, equos sustinebo, eoque magis, si locus is, quo ferentur equi,
  praeceps erit. Sic me, inquit, ante sustineo nec diutius captiose
  interroganti respondeo. Si habes quod liqueat neque respondes, superbus
  es: si non habes, ne tu quidem percipis. Si, quia obscura, concedo. Sed
  negas te usque ad obscura progredi. Illustribus igitur rebus insistis. Si
  id tantum modo, ut taceas, nihil adsequeris. Quid enim ad illum, qui te
  captare volt, utrum tacentem irretiat te an loquentem? Sin autem usque ad
  novem, verbi gratia, sine dubitatione respondes pauca esse, in decimo
  insistis: etiam a certis et illustrioribus cohibes adsensum. Hoc idem me
  in obscuris facere non sinis. Nihil igitur te contra soritas ars ista
  adiuvat, quae nec augentis nec minuentis quid aut primum sit aut
  postremum docet. <a name="BkII_95"></a><a href="#BkIIN_95">95</a>. Quid?
  quod eadem illa ars, quasi Penelope telam retexens, tollit ad extremum
  superiora. Utrum ea vestra an nostra culpa est? Nempe fundamentum
  dialecticae est, quidquid enuntietur&mdash;id autem appellant <span
  lang="el" title="axiôma"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3C9;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;</span>, quod est quasi
  effatum&mdash;, aut verum esse aut falsum. Quid igitur? haec vera an
  falsa sunt? Si te mentiri dicis idque verum dicis, mentiris <i>an</i>
  verum dicis? Haec scilicet inexplicabilia esse dicitis. Quod est odiosius
  quam illa, quae nos non comprehensa et non percepta dicimus.</p>

  <p>XXX. Sed hoc omitto. Illud quaero, si ista explicari non possunt, nec
  eorum ullum iudicium invenitur, ut respondere possitis verane an falsa
  sint, ubi est illa definitio: 'effatum esse id, quod aut verum aut falsum
  sit'? Rebus sumptis adiungam ex his sequendas esse alias, alias
  improbandas, quae sint in genere contrario. <a name="BkII_96"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_96">96</a>. Quo modo igitur hoc conclusum esse iudicas? 'Si
  dicis <i>nunc lucere et verum dicis, lucet; dicis autem</i> nunc lucere
  et verum dicis: lucet igitur.' Probatis certe genus et rectissime
  conclusum dicitis. Itaque in docendo eum primum concludendi modum
  traditis. Aut quidquid igitur eodem modo concluditur probabitis aut ars
  ista nulla est. Vide ergo hanc conclusionem probaturusne sis: 'Si dicis
  te mentiri verumque dicis, mentiris; dicis autem te mentiri verumque
  dicis, mentiris igitur.' Qui potes hanc non probare, cum probaveris
  eiusdem generis superiorem? Haec Chrysippea sunt, ne ab ipso quidem
  dissoluta. Quid enim faceret huic conclusioni? 'Si lucet, lucet; lucet
  autem: lucet igitur.' Cederet scilicet. Ipsa enim ratio conexi, cum
  concesseris superius, cogit inferius concedere. Quid ergo haec ab illa
  conclusione differt? 'Si mentiris, mentiris: mentiris autem: mentiris
  igitur.' Hoc negas te posse nec approbare nec improbare. <a
  name="BkII_97"></a><a href="#BkIIN_97">97</a>. Qui igitur magis illud? Si
  ars, si ratio, si via, si vis denique conclusionis valet, eadem est in
  utroque. Sed hoc extremum eorum est: postulant ut excipiantur haec
  inexplicabilia. Tribunum aliquem censeo adeant: a me istam exceptionem
  numquam impetrabunt. Etenim cum ab Epicuro, qui totam dialecticam et
  contemnit et irridet, non impetrent ut verum esse concedat quod ita
  effabimur, 'aut vivet cras Hermarchus aut non vivet' cum dialectici sic
  statuant, omne, quod ita diiunctum sit, quasi 'aut etiam aut non,' non
  modo verum esse, sed etiam necessarium: vide quam sit catus is, quem isti
  tardum putant. Si enim, inquit, alterutrum concessero necessarium esse,
  necesse erit cras Hermarchum aut vivere aut non vivere; nulla autem est
  in natura rerum talis necessitas. Cum hoc igitur dialectici pugnent, id
  est, Antiochus et Stoici: totam enim evertit dialecticam. Nam si e
  contrariis diiunctio&mdash;contraria autem ea dico, cum alterum aiat,
  alterum neget, si talis diiunctio falsa potest esse, nulla vera est. <a
  name="BkII_98"></a><a href="#BkIIN_98">98</a>. Mecum vero quid habent
  litium, qui ipsorum disciplinam sequor? Cum aliquid huius modi inciderat,
  sic ludere Carneades solebat: 'Si recte conclusi, teneo: sin vitiose,
  minam Diogenes reddet.' Ab eo enim Stoico dialecticam didicerat: haec
  autem merces erat dialecticorum. Sequor igitur eas vias, quas didici ab
  Antiocho, nec reperio quo modo iudicem 'si lucet, lucet,' verum esse ob
  eam causam, quod ita didici, omne, quod ipsum ex se conexum sit, verum
  esse, non iudicem 'si mentiris, mentiris,' eodem modo [esse] conexum. Aut
  igitur hoc et illud aut, nisi hoc, ne illud quidem iudicabo.</p>

  <p>XXXI. Sed, ut omnes istos aculeos et totum tortuosum genus disputandi
  relinquamus ostendamusque qui simus, iam explicata tota Carneadis
  sententia Antiochea ista corruent universa. Nec vero quicquam ita dicam,
  ut quisquam id fingi suspicetur: a Clitomacho sumam, qui usque ad
  senectutem cum Carneade fuit, homo et acutus, ut Poenus, et valde
  studiosus ac diligens. Et quattuor eius libri sunt de sustinendis
  adsensionibus. Haec autem, quae iam dicam, sunt sumpta de primo. <a
  name="BkII_99"></a><a href="#BkIIN_99">99</a>. Duo placet esse Carneadi
  genera visorum, in uno hanc divisionem: 'alia visa esse quae percipi
  possint, alia quae non possint,' in altero autem: 'alia visa esse
  probabilia; alia non probabilia.' Itaque, quae contra sensus contraque
  perspicuitatem dicantur, ea pertinere ad superiorem divisionem: contra
  posteriorem nihil dici oportere: qua re ita placere: tale visum nullum
  esse, ut perceptio consequeretur, ut autem probatio, multa. Etenim contra
  naturam esset, si probabile nihil esset. Et sequitur omnis vitae ea, quam
  tu, Luculle, commemorabas, eversio. Itaque et sensibus probanda multa
  sunt, teneatur modo illud, non inesse in iis quicquam tale, quale non
  etiam falsum nihil ab eo differens esse possit. Sic, quidquid acciderit
  specie probabile, si nihil se offeret quod sit probabilitati illi
  contrarium, utetur eo sapiens ac sic omnis ratio vitae gubernabitur.
  Etenim is quoque, qui a vobis sapiens inducitur, multa sequitur
  probabilia, non comprehensa neque percepta neque adsensa, sed similia
  veri: quae nisi probet, omnis vita tollatur. <a name="BkII_100"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_100">100</a>. Quid enim? conscendens navem sapiens num
  comprehensum animo habet atque perceptum se ex sententia navigaturum? Qui
  potest? Sed si iam ex hoc loco proficiscatur Puteolos stadia triginta,
  probo navigio, bono gubernatore, hac tranquillitate, probabile videatur
  se illuc venturum esse salvum. Huius modi igitur visis consilia capiet et
  agendi et non agendi, faciliorque erit, ut albam esse nivem probet, quam
  erat Anaxagoras, qui id non modo ita esse negabat, sed sibi, quia sciret
  aquam nigram esse, unde illa concreta esset, albam ipsam esse, ne videri
  quidem. <a name="BkII_101"></a><a href="#BkIIN_101">101</a>. Et
  quaecumque res eum sic attinget, ut sit visum illud probabile neque ulla
  re impeditum, movebitur. Non enim est e saxo sculptus aut e robore
  dolatus, habet corpus, habet animum, movetur mente, movetur sensibus, ut
  ei multa vera videantur, neque tamen habere insignem illam et propriam
  percipiendi notam: eoque sapientem non adsentiri, quia possit eiusdem
  modi exsistere falsum aliquod, cuius modi hoc verum. Neque nos contra
  sensus aliter dicimus ac Stoici, qui multa falsa esse dicunt, longeque
  aliter se habere ac sensibus videantur.</p>

  <p>XXXII. Hoc autem si ita sit, ut unum modo sensibus falsum videatur,
  praesto est qui neget rem ullam percipi posse sensibus. Ita nobis
  tacentibus ex uno Epicuri capite, altero vestro perceptio et comprehensio
  tollitur. Quod est caput Epicuri? 'Si ullum sensus visum falsum est,
  nihil percipi potest.' Quod vestrum? 'Sunt falsa sensus visa.' Quid
  sequitur? ut taceam, conclusio ipsa loquitur: 'nihil posse percipi.' Non
  concedo, inquit, Epicuro. Certa igitur cum illo, qui a te totus diversus
  est: noli mecum, qui hoc quidem certe, falsi esse aliquid in sensibus,
  tibi adsentior. <a name="BkII_102"></a><a href="#BkIIN_102">102</a>.
  Quamquam nihil mihi tam mirum videtur quam ista dici, ab Antiocho quidem
  maxime, cui erant ea, quae paulo ante dixi, notissima. Licet enim haec
  quivis arbitratu suo reprehendat, quod negemus rem ullam percipi posse,
  certe levior reprehensio est: quod tamen dicimus esse quaedam probabilia,
  non videtur hoc satis esse vobis. Ne sit: illa certe debemus effugere,
  quae a te vel maxime agitata sunt: 'nihil igitur cernis? nihil audis?
  nihil tibi est perspicuum?' Explicavi paulo ante Clitomacho auctore quo
  modo ista Carneades diceret. Accipe quem ad modum eadem dicantur a
  Clitomacho in eo libro, quem ad C. Lucilium scripsit poëtam, cum
  scripsisset isdem de rebus ad L. Censorinum, eum, qui consul cum M.
  Manilio fuit. Scripsit igitur his fere verbis&mdash;sunt enim mihi nota,
  propterea quod earum ipsarum rerum, de quibus agimus, prima institutio et
  quasi disciplina illo libro continetur&mdash;, sed scriptum est ita: <a
  name="BkII_103"></a><a href="#BkIIN_103">103</a>. 'Academicis placere
  esse rerum eius modi dissimilitudines, ut aliae probabiles videantur,
  aliae contra: id autem non esse satis cur alia posse percipi dicas, alia
  non posse, propterea quod multa falsa probabilia sint, nihil autem falsi
  perceptum et cognitum possit esse.' Itaque ait vehementer errare eos, qui
  dicant ab Academia sensus eripi, a quibus numquam dictum sit aut colorem
  aut saporem aut sonum nullum esse, illud sit disputatum, non inesse in
  his propriam, quae nusquam alibi esset, veri et certi notam. <a
  name="BkII_104"></a><a href="#BkIIN_104">104</a>. Quae cum exposuisset,
  adiungit dupliciter dici adsensus sustinere sapientem: uno modo, cum hoc
  intelligatur, omnino eum rei nulli adsentiri: altero, cum se a
  respondendo, ut aut approbet quid aut improbet, sustineat, ut neque neget
  aliquid neque aiat. Id cum ita sit, alterum placere, ut numquam
  adsentiatur, alterum tenere, ut sequens probabilitatem, ubicumque haec
  aut occurrat aut deficiat, aut 'etiam' aut 'non' respondere possit.
  &#x2020;Nec, ut placeat, eum, qui de omnibus rebus contineat se ab
  adsentiendo, moveri tamen et agere aliquid, reliquit eius modi visa,
  quibus ad actionem excitemur: item ea, quae interrogati in utramque
  partem respondere possimus, sequentes tantum modo, quod ita visum sit,
  dum sine adsensu: neque tamen omnia eius modi visa approbari, sed ea,
  quae nulla re impedirentur. <a name="BkII_105"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_105">105</a>. Haec si vobis non probamus, sint falsa sane,
  invidiosa certe non sunt. Non enim lucem eripimus, sed ea, quae vos
  percipi comprehendique, eadem nos, si modo probabilia sint, videri
  dicimus.</p>

  <p>XXXIII. Sic igitur inducto et constituto probabili, et eo quidem
  expedito, soluto, libero, nulla re implicato, vides profecto, Luculle,
  iacere iam illud tuum perspicuitatis patrocinium. Isdem enim hic sapiens,
  de quo loquor, oculis quibus iste vester caelum, terram, mare intuebitur,
  isdem sensibus reliqua, quae sub quemque sensum cadunt, sentiet. Mare
  illud, quod nunc Favonio nascente purpureum videtur, idem huic nostro
  videbitur, nec tamen adsentietur, quia nobismet ipsis modo caeruleum
  videbatur, mane ravum, quodque nunc, qua a sole collucet, albescit et
  vibrat dissimileque est proximo et continenti, ut, etiam si possis
  rationem reddere cur id eveniat, tamen non possis id verum esse, quod
  videbatur oculis, defendere. <a name="BkII_106"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_106">106</a>. Unde memoria, si nihil percipimus? Sic enim
  quaerebas. Quid? meminisse visa nisi comprehensa non possumus? Quid?
  Polyaenus, qui magnus mathematicus fuisse dicitur, is postea quam Epicuro
  adsentiens totam geometriam falsam esse credidit, num illa etiam, quae
  sciebat, oblitus est? Atqui, falsum quod est, id percipi non potest, ut
  vobismet ipsis placet. Si igitur memoria perceptarum comprehensarumque
  rerum est, omnia, quae quisque meminit, habet ea comprehensa atque
  percepta. Falsi autem comprehendi nihil potest, et omnia meminit Siron
  Epicuri dogmata. Vera igitur illa sunt nunc omnia. Hoc per me licet: sed
  tibi aut concedendum est ita esse, quod minime vis, aut memoriam mihi
  remittas oportet et fateare esse ei locum, etiam si comprehensio
  perceptioque nulla sit. <a name="BkII_107"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_107">107</a>. Quid fiet artibus? Quibus? Iisne, quae ipsae
  fatentur coniectura se plus uti quam scientia, an iis, quae tantum id,
  quod videtur, secuntur nec habent istam artem vestram, qua vera et falsa
  diiudicent?</p>

  <p>Sed illa sunt lumina duo, quae maxime causam istam continent. Primum
  enim negatis fieri posse ut quisquam nulli rei adsentiatur. At id quidem
  perspicuum est. Cum Panaetius, princeps prope meo quidem iudicio
  Stoicorum, ea de re dubitare se dicat, quam omnes praeter eum Stoici
  certissimam putant, vera esse haruspicum [<i>responsa</i>], auspicia,
  oracula, somnia, vaticinationes, seque ab adsensu sustineat: quod is
  potest facere vel de iis rebus, quas illi, a quibus ipse didicit, certas
  habuerint, cur id sapiens de reliquis rebus facere non possit? An est
  aliquid, quod positum vel improbare vel approbare possit, dubitare non
  possit? an tu in soritis poteris hoc, cum voles: ille in reliquis rebus
  non poterit eodem modo insistere, praesertim cum possit sine adsensione
  ipsam veri similitudinem non impeditam sequi? <a name="BkII_108"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_108">108</a>. Alterum est, quod negatis actionem ullius rei
  posse in eo esse, qui nullam rem adsensu suo comprobet. Primum enim
  videri oportet in quo sit etiam adsensus. Dicunt enim Stoici sensus ipsos
  adsensus esse, quos quoniam appetitio consequatur, actionem sequi: tolli
  autem omnia, si visa tollantur.</p>

  <p>XXXIV. Hac de re in utramque partem et dicta sunt et scripta multa,
  sed brevi res potest tota confici. Ego enim etsi maximam actionem puto
  repugnare visis, obsistere opinionibus, adsensus lubricos sustinere,
  credoque Clitomacho ita scribenti, Herculi quendam laborem exanclatum a
  Carneade, quod, ut feram et immanem beluam, sic ex animis nostris
  adsensionem, id est, opinationem et temeritatem extraxisset, tamen, ut ea
  pars defensionis relinquatur, quid impediet actionem eius, qui probabilia
  sequitur, nulla re impediente? <a name="BkII_109"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_109">109</a>. Hoc, inquit, ipsum impediet, quod statuet, ne
  id quidem, quod probet, posse percipi. Iam istuc te quoque impediet in
  navigando, in conserendo, in uxore ducenda, in liberis procreandis
  plurimisque in rebus, in quibus nihil sequere praeter probabile.</p>

  <p>Et tamen illud usitatum et saepe repudiatum refers, non ut Antipater,
  sed, ut ais, 'pressius.' Nam Antipatrum reprehensum, quod diceret
  consentaneum esse ei, qui adfirmaret nihil posse comprehendi, id ipsum
  saltem dicere posse comprehendi, quod ipsi Antiocho pingue videbatur et
  sibi ipsum contrarium. Non enim potest convenienter dici nihil
  comprehendi posse, si quicquam comprehendi posse dicatur. Illo modo
  potius putat urguendum fuisse Carneadem: cum sapientis nullum decretum
  esse possit nisi comprehensum, perceptum, cognitum, ut hoc ipsum
  decretum, quod sapientis esset, nihil posse percipi, fateretur esse
  perceptum. Proinde quasi nullum sapiens aliud decretum habeat et sine
  decretis vitam agere possit! <a name="BkII_110"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_110">110</a>. Sed ut illa habet probabilia non percepta, sic
  hoc ipsum, nihil posse percipi. Nam si in hoc haberet cognitionis notam,
  eadem uteretur in ceteris. Quam quoniam non habet, utitur probabilibus.
  Itaque non metuit ne confundere omnia videatur et incerta reddere. Non
  enim, quem ad modum, si quaesitum ex eo sit, stellarum numerus par an
  impar sit, item, si de officio multisque aliis de rebus, in quibus
  versatus exercitatusque sit, nescire se dicat. In incertis enim nihil
  probabile est, in quibus autem est, in iis non deerit sapienti nec quid
  faciat nec quid respondeat. <a name="BkII_111"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_111">111</a>. Ne illam quidem praetermisisti, Luculle,
  reprehensionem Antiochi&mdash;nec mirum: in primis enim est
  nobilis&mdash;, qua solebat dicere Antiochus Philonem maxime perturbatum.
  Cum enim sumeretur, unum, esse quaedam falsa visa, alterum nihil ea
  differre a veris, non adtendere, superius illud ea re a se esse
  concessum, quod videretur esse quaedam in vivis differentia, eam tolli
  altero, quo neget visa a falsis vera differre; nihil tam repugnare. Id
  ita esset, si nos verum omnino tolleremus. Non facimus. Nam tam vera quam
  falsa cernimus. Sed probandi species est: percipiendi signum nullum
  habemus.</p>

  <p>XXXV. <a name="BkII_112"></a><a href="#BkIIN_112">112</a>. Ac mihi
  videor nimis etiam nunc agere ieiune. Cum sit enim campus in quo
  exsultare possit oratio, cur eam tantas in angustias et in Stoicorum
  dumeta compellimus? si enim mihi cum Peripatetico res esset, qui id
  percipi posse diceret, 'quod impressum esset e vero,' neque adhiberet
  illam magnam accessionem, 'quo modo imprimi non posset a falso,' cum
  simplici homine simpliciter agerem nec magno opere contenderem atque
  etiam, si, cum ego nihil dicerem posse comprehendi, diceret ille
  sapientem interdum opinari, non repugnarem, praesertim ne Carneade quidem
  huic loco valde repugnante: nunc quid facere possum? <a
  name="BkII_113"></a><a href="#BkIIN_113">113</a>. Quaero enim quid sit
  quod comprehendi possit. Respondet mihi non Aristoteles aut Theophrastus,
  ne Xenocrates quidem aut Polemo, sed qui his minor est: 'tale verum quale
  falsum esse non possit.' Nihil eius modo invenio. Itaque incognito
  nimirum adsentiar, id est, opinabor. Hoc mihi et Peripatetici et vetus
  Academia concedit: vos negatis, Antiochus in primis, qui me valde movet,
  vel quod amavi hominem, sicut ille me, vel quod ita iudico, politissimum
  et acutissimum omnium nostrae memoriae philosophorum. A quo primum quaero
  quo tandem modo sit eius Academiae, cuius esse se profiteatur? Ut omittam
  alia, haec duo, de quibus agitur, quis umquam dixit aut veteris Academiae
  aut Peripateticorum, vel id solum percipi posse, quod esset verum tale,
  quale falsum esse non posset, vel sapientem nihil opinari? Certe nemo.
  Horum neutrum ante Zenonem magno opere defensum est. Ego tamen utrumque
  verum puto, nec dico temporis causa, sed ita plane probo.</p>

  <p>XXXVI. <a name="BkII_114"></a><a href="#BkIIN_114">114</a>. Illud
  ferre non possum. Tu cum me incognito adsentiri vetes idque turpissimum
  esse dicas et plenissimum temeritatis, tantum tibi adroges, ut exponas
  disciplinam sapientiae, naturam rerum omnium evolvas, mores fingas, finis
  bonorum malorumque constituas, officia describas, quam vitam ingrediar
  definias, idemque etiam disputandi et intellegendi iudicium dicas te et
  artificium traditurum, perficies ut ego ista innumerabilia complectens
  nusquam labar, nihil opiner? Quae tandem ea est disciplina, ad quam me
  deducas, si ab hac abstraxeris? Vereor ne subadroganter facias, si
  dixeris tuam. Atqui ita dicas necesse est. <a name="BkII_115"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_115">115</a>. Neque vero tu solus, sed ad suam quisque
  rapiet. Age, restitero Peripateticis, qui sibi cum oratoribus cognationem
  esse, qui claros viros a se instructos dicant rem publicam saepe rexisse,
  sustinuero Epicureos, tot meos familiaris, tam bonos, tam inter se
  amantis viros, Diodoto quid faciam Stoico, quem a puero audivi? qui mecum
  vivit tot annos? qui habitat apud me? quem et admiror et diligo? qui ista
  Antiochea contemnit? Nostra, inquies, sola vera sunt. Certe sola, si
  vera: plura enim vera discrepantia esse non possunt. Utrum igitur nos
  impudentes, qui labi nolumus, an illi adrogantes, qui sibi persuaserint
  scire se solos omnia? Non me quidem, inquit, sed sapientem dico scire.
  Optime: nempe ista scire, quae sunt in tua disciplina. Hoc primum quale
  est, a non sapiente explicari sapientiam? Sed discedamus a nobismet
  ipsis, de sapiente loquamur, de quo, ut saepe iam dixi, omnis haec
  quaestio est.</p>

  <p><a name="BkII_116"></a><a href="#BkIIN_116">116</a>. In tres igitur
  partis et a plerisque et a vobismet ipsis distributa sapientia est.
  Primum ergo, si placet, quae de natura rerum sint quaesita, videamus: at
  illud ante. Estne quisquam tanto inflatus errore, ut sibi se illa scire
  persuaserit? Non quaero rationes eas, quae ex coniectura pendent, quae
  disputationibus huc et illuc trahuntur, nullam adhibent persuadendi
  necessitatem. Geometrae provideant, qui se profitentur non persuadere,
  sed cogere, et qui omnia vobis, quae describunt, probant. Non quaero ex
  his illa initia mathematicorum, quibus non concessis digitum progredi non
  possunt. Punctum esse quod magnitudinem nullam habeat: extremitatem et
  quasi libramentum in quo nulla omnino crassitudo sit: liniamentum sine
  ulla latitudine [carentem]. Haec cum vera esse concessero, si adigam ius
  iurandum sapientem, nec prius quam Archimedes eo inspectante rationes
  omnis descripserit eas, quibus efficitur multis partibus solem maiorem
  esse quam terram, iuraturum putas? Si fecerit, solem ipsum, quem deum
  censet esse, contempserit. <a name="BkII_117"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_117">117</a>. Quod si geometricis rationibus non est
  crediturus, quae vim adferunt in docendo, vos ipsi ut dicitis, ne ille
  longe aberit ut argumentis credat philosophorum, aut, si est crediturus,
  quorum potissimum? Omnia enim physicorum licet explicare; sed longum est:
  quaero tamen quem sequatur. Finge aliquem nunc fieri sapientem, nondum
  esse, quam potissimum sententiam eliget <i>et</i> disciplinam? Etsi
  quamcumque eliget, insipiens eliget. Sed sit ingenio divino, quem unum e
  physicis potissimum probabit? Nec plus uno poterit. Non persequor
  quaestiones infinitas: tantum de principiis rerum, e quibus omnia
  constant, videamus quem probet: est enim inter magnos homines summa
  dissensio.</p>

  <p>XXXVII. <a name="BkII_118"></a><a href="#BkIIN_118">118</a>. Princeps
  Thales, unus e septem, cui sex reliquos concessisse primas ferunt, ex
  aqua dixit constare omnia. At hoc Anaximandro, populari et sodali suo,
  non persuasit: is enim infinitatem naturae dixit esse, e qua omnia
  gignerentur. Post eius auditor Anaximenes infinitum aëra, sed ea, quae ex
  eo orirentur, definita: gigni autem terram, aquam, ignem, tum ex his
  omnia. Anaxagoras materiam infinitam, sed ex ea particulas, similis inter
  se, minutas, eas primum confusas, postea in ordinem adductas a mente
  divina. Xenophanes, paulo etiam antiquior, unum esse omnia neque id esse
  mutabile et id esse deum neque natum umquam et sempiternum, conglobata
  figura: Parmenides ignem, qui moveat terram, quae ab eo formetur:
  Leucippus, plenum et inane: Democritus huic in hoc similis, uberior in
  ceteris: Empedocles haec pervolgata et nota quattuor: Heraclitus ignem:
  Melissus hoc, quod esset infinitum et immutabile, et fuisse semper et
  fore. Plato ex materia in se omnia recipiente mundum factum esse censet a
  deo sempiternum. Pythagorei ex numeris et mathematicorum initiis
  proficisci volunt omnia. Ex his eliget vester sapiens unum aliquem,
  credo, quem sequatur: ceteri tot viri et tanti repudiati ab eo
  condemnatique discedent. <a name="BkII_119"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_119">119</a>. Quamcumque vero sententiam probaverit, eam sic
  animo comprehensam habebit, ut ea, quae sensibus, nec magis approbabit
  nunc lucere, quam, quoniam Stoicus est, hunc mundum esse sapientem,
  habere mentem, quae et se et ipsum fabricata sit et omnia moderetur,
  moveat, regat. Erit ei persuasum etiam solem, lunam, stellas omnis,
  terram, mare deos esse, quod quaedam animalis intellegentia per omnia ea
  permanet et transeat, fore tamen aliquando ut omnis hic mundus ardore
  deflagret.</p>

  <p>XXXVIII. Sint ista vera&mdash;vides enim iam me fateri aliquid esse
  veri&mdash;, comprehendi ea tamen et percipi nego. Cum enim tuus iste
  Stoicus sapiens syllabatim tibi ista dixerit, veniet flumen orationis
  aureum fundens Aristoteles, qui illum desipere dicat: neque enim ortum
  esse umquam mundum, quod nulla fuerit novo consilio inito tam praeclari
  operis inceptio, et ita esse eum undique aptum, ut nulla vis tantos queat
  motus mutationemque moliri, nulla senectus diuturnitate temporum
  exsistere, ut hic ornatus umquam dilapsus occidat. Tibi hoc repudiare,
  illud autem superius sicut caput et famam tuam defendere necesse erit,
  cum mihi ne ut dubitem quidem relinquatur. <a name="BkII_120"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_120">120</a>. Ut omittam levitatem temere adsentientium,
  quanti libertas ipsa aestimanda est non mihi necesse esse quod tibi est?
  Cur deus, omnia nostra causa cum faceret&mdash;sic enim voltis&mdash;,
  tantam vim natricum viperarumque fecerit? cur mortifera tam multa
  <i>ac</i> perniciosa terra marique disperserit? Negatis haec tam polite
  tamque subtiliter effici potuisse sine divina aliqua sollertia. Cuius
  quidem vos maiestatem deducitis usque ad apium formicarumque
  perfectionem, ut etiam inter deos Myrmecides aliquis minutorum
  opusculorum fabricator fuisse videatur. <a name="BkII_121"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_121">121</a>. Negas sine deo posse quicquam. Ecce tibi e
  transverso Lampsacenus Strato, qui det isti deo immunitatem magni quidem
  muneris: sed cum sacerdotes deorum vacationem habeant, quanto est aequius
  habere ipsos deos! Negat opera deorum se uti ad fabricandum mundum.
  Quaecumque sint, docet omnia effecta esse natura, nec, ut ille, qui
  asperis et levibus et hamatis uncinatisque corporibus concreta haec esse
  dicat interiecto inani. Somnia censet haec esse Democriti non docentis,
  sed optantis. Ipse autem singulas mundi partis persequens, quidquid aut
  sit aut fiat, naturalibus fieri aut factum esse docet ponderibus et
  motibus. Ne ille et deum opere magno liberat et me timore. Quis enim
  potest, cum existimet curari se a deo, non et dies et noctes divinum
  numen horrere et, si quid adversi acciderit&mdash;quod cui non
  accidit?&mdash;extimescere ne id iure evenerit? Nec Stratoni tamen
  adsentior, nec vero tibi. Modo hoc, modo illud probabilius videtur.</p>

  <p>XXXIX. <a name="BkII_122"></a><a href="#BkIIN_122">122</a>. Latent
  ista omnia, Luculle, crassis occultata et circumfusa tenebris, ut nulla
  acies humani ingeni tanta sit, quae penetrare in caelum, terram intrare
  possit: corpora nostra non novimus: qui sint situs partium, quam vim
  quaeque pars habeat ignoramus. Itaque medici ipsi, quorum intererat ea
  nosse, aperuerunt, ut viderentur. Nec eo tamen aiunt empirici notiora
  esse illa, quia possit fieri ut patefacta et detecta mutentur. Sed ecquid
  nos eodem modo rerum naturas persecare, aperire, dividere possumus, ut
  videamus terra penitusne defixa sit et quasi radicibus suis haereat an
  media pendeat? <a name="BkII_123"></a><a href="#BkIIN_123">123</a>.
  Habitari ait Xenophanes in luna eamque esse terram multarum urbium et
  montium. Portenta videntur, sed tamen neque ille, qui dixit, iurare
  posset, ita se rem habere, neque ego non ita. Vos etiam dicitis esse e
  regione nobis, e contraria parte terrae, qui adversis vestigiis stent
  contra nostra vestigia, quos <span lang="el" title="antipodas"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3B4;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span>
  vocatis: cur mihi magis suscensetis, qui ista non aspernor, quam iis,
  qui, cum audiunt, desipere vos arbitrantur? Hicetas Syracusius, ut ait
  Theophrastus, caelum, solem, lunam, stellas, supera denique omnia stare
  censet neque praeter terram rem ullam in mundo moveri: quae cum circum
  axem se summa celeritate convertat et torqueat, eadem effici omnia, quae,
  si stante terra caelum moveretur. Atque hoc etiam Platonem in Timaeo
  dicere quidam arbitrantur, sed paulo obscurius. Quid tu, Epicure?
  loquere. Putas solem esse tantulum? Egone? ne bis quidem tantum! Et vos
  ab illo irridemini et ipsi illum vicissim eluditis. Liber igitur a tali
  irrisione Socrates, liber Aristo Chius, qui nihil istorum sciri putat
  posse. <a name="BkII_124"></a><a href="#BkIIN_124">124</a>. Sed redeo ad
  animum et corpus. Satisne tandem ea nota sunt nobis, quae nervorum natura
  sit, quae venarum? tenemusne quid sit animus, ubi sit? denique sitne an,
  ut Dicaearcho visum est, ne sit quidem ullus? Si est, tresne partis
  habeat, ut Platoni placuit, rationis, irae, cupiditatis, an simplex
  unusque sit? si simplex, utrum sit ignis an anima an sanguis an, ut
  Xenocrates, numerus nullo corpore&mdash;quod intellegi quale sit vix
  potest&mdash;et, quidquid est, mortale sit an aeternum? nam utramque in
  partem multa dicuntur. Horum aliquid vestro sapienti certum videtur,
  nostro ne quid maxime quidem probabile sit occurrit: ita sunt in
  plerisque contrariarum rationum paria momenta.</p>

  <p>XL. <a name="BkII_125"></a><a href="#BkIIN_125">125</a>. Sin agis
  verecundius et me accusas, non quod tuis rationibus non adsentiar, sed
  quod nullis, vincam animum cuique adsentiar deligam ... quem potissimum?
  quem? Democritum: semper enim, ut scitis, studiosus nobilitatis fui.
  Urguebor iam omnium vestrum convicio. Tune aut inane quicquam putes esse,
  cum ita completa et conferta sint omnia, ut et quod movebitur corporum
  cedat et qua quidque cesserit aliud ilico subsequatur? aut atomos ullas,
  e quibus quidquid efficiatur, illarum sit dissimillimum? aut sine aliqua
  mente rem ullam effici posse praeclaram? et cum in uno mundo ornatus hic
  tam sit mirabilis, innumerabilis supra infra, dextra sinistra, ante post,
  alios dissimilis, alios eiusdem modi mundos esse? et, ut nos nunc simus
  ad Baulos Puteolosque videamus, sic innumerabilis paribus in locis isdem
  esse nominibus, honoribus, rebus gestis, ingeniis, formis, aetatibus,
  isdem de rebus disputantis? et, si nunc aut si etiam dormientes aliquid
  animo videre videamur, imagines extrinsecus in animos nostros per corpus
  irrumpere? Tu vero ista ne asciveris neve fueris commenticiis rebus
  adsensus. Nihil sentire est melius quam tam prava sentire. <a
  name="BkII_126"></a><a href="#BkIIN_126">126</a>. Non ergo id agitur, ut
  aliquid adsensu meo comprobem; quae tu, vide ne impudenter etiam
  postules, non solum adroganter, praesertim cum ista tua mihi ne
  probabilia quidem videantur. Nec enim divinationem, quam probatis, ullam
  esse arbitror, fatumque illud, quo omnia contineri dicitis, contemno. Ne
  exaedificatum quidem hunc mundum divino consilio existimo, atque haud
  scio an ita sit.</p>

  <p>XLI. Sed cur rapior in invidiam? licetne per vos nescire quod nescio?
  an Stoicis ipsis inter se disceptare, cum his non licebit? Zenoni et
  reliquis fere Stoicis aether videtur summus deus, mente praeditus, qua
  omnia regantur. Cleanthes, qui quasi maiorum est gentium Stoicus, Zenonis
  auditor, solem dominari et rerum potiri putat. Ita cogimur dissensione
  sapientium dominum nostrum ignorare, quippe qui nesciamus soli an aetheri
  serviamus. Solis autem magnitudinem&mdash;ipse enim hic radiatus me
  intueri videtur ac monet ut crebro faciam mentionem sui&mdash;vos ergo
  huius magnitudinem quasi decempeda permensi refertis: huic me quasi malis
  architectis mensurae vestrae nego credere. Ergo dubium est uter nostrum
  sit, leniter ut dicam, verecundior? <a name="BkII_127"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_127">127</a>. Neque tamen istas quaestiones physicorum
  exterminandas puto. Est enim animorum ingeniorumque naturale quoddam
  quasi pabulum consideratio contemplatioque naturae. Erigimur, elatiores
  fieri videmur, humana despicimus, cogitantesque supera atque caelestia
  haec nostra ut exigua et minima contemnimus. Indagatio ipsa rerum cum
  maximarum tum etiam occultissimarum habet oblectationem. Si vero aliquid
  occurrit, quod veri simile videatur, humanissima completur animus
  voluptate. <a name="BkII_128"></a><a href="#BkIIN_128">128</a>. Quaeret
  igitur haec et vester sapiens et hic noster, sed vester, ut adsentiatur,
  credat, adfirmet, noster, ut vereatur temere opinari praeclareque agi
  secum putet, si in eius modi rebus veri simile quod sit invenerit.
  Veniamus nunc ad bonorum malorumque notionem: at paulum ante dicendum
  est. Non mihi videntur considerare, cum physica ista valde adfirmant,
  earum etiam rerum auctoritatem, si quae illustriores videantur, amittere.
  Non enim magis adsentiuntur neque approbant lucere nunc, quam, cum cornix
  cecinerit, tum aliquid eam aut iubere aut vetare, nec magis adfirmabunt
  signum illud, si erunt mensi, sex pedum esse quam solem, quem metiri non
  possunt, plus quam duodeviginti partibus maiorem esse quam terram. Ex quo
  illa conclusio nascitur: si sol quantus sit percipi non potest, qui
  ceteras res eodem modo quo magnitudinem solis approbat, is eas res non
  percipit. Magnitudo autem solis percipi non potest. Qui igitur id
  approbat, quasi percipiat, nullam rem percipit. Responderint posse
  percipi quantus sol sit. Non repugnabo, dum modo eodem pacto cetera
  percipi comprehendique dicant. Nec enim possunt dicere aliud alio magis
  minusve comprehendi, quoniam omnium rerum una est definitio
  comprehendendi.</p>

  <p>XLII. <a name="BkII_129"></a><a href="#BkIIN_129">129</a>. Sed quod
  coeperam: Quid habemus in rebus bonis et malis explorati? nempe fines
  constituendi sunt ad quos et bonorum et malorum summa referatur: qua de
  re est igitur inter summos viros maior dissensio? Omitto illa, quae
  relicta iam videntur, ut Herillum, qui in cognitione et scientia summum
  bonum ponit: qui cum Zenonis auditor esset, vides quantum ab eo
  dissenserit et quam non multum a Platone. Megaricorum fuit nobilis
  disciplina, cuius, ut scriptum video, princeps Xenophanes, quem modo
  nominavi, deinde eum secuti Parmenides et Zeno, itaque ab his Eleatici
  philosophi nominabantur. Post Euclides, Socratis discipulus, Megareus, a
  quo iidem illi Megarici dicti, qui id bonum solum esse dicebant, quod
  esset unum et simile et idem semper. Hic quoque multa a Platone. A
  Menedemo autem, quod is Eretria fuit, Eretriaci appellati, quorum omne
  bonum in mente positum et mentis acie, qua verum cerneretur, Herilli
  similia, sed, opinor, explicata uberius et ornatius. <a
  name="BkII_130"></a><a href="#BkIIN_130">130</a>. Hos si contemnimus et
  iam abiectos putamus, illos certe minus despicere debemus, Aristonem, qui
  cum Zenonis fuisset auditor, re probavit ea quae ille verbis, nihil esse
  bonum nisi virtutem, nec malum nisi quod virtuti esset contrarium: in
  mediis ea momenta, quae Zeno voluit, nulla esse censuit. Huic summum
  bonum est in his rebus neutram in partem moveri, quae <span lang="el"
  title="adiaphoria"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>
  ab ipso dicitur. Pyrrho autem ea ne sentire quidem sapientem, quae <span
  lang="el" title="apatheia"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> nominatur. Has
  igitur tot sententias ut omittamus, haec nunc videamus, quae diu
  multumque defensa sunt. <a name="BkII_131"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_131">131</a>. Alii voluptatem finem esse voluerunt: quorum
  princeps Aristippus, qui Socratem audierat, unde Cyrenaici. Post
  Epicurus, cuius est disciplina nunc notior, neque tamen cum Cyrenaicis de
  ipsa voluptate consentiens. Voluptatem autem et honestatem finem esse
  Callipho censuit: vacare omni molestia Hieronymus: hoc idem cum honestate
  Diodorus: ambo hi Peripatetici. Honeste autem vivere fruentem rebus iis,
  quas primas homini natura conciliet, et vetus Academia censuit, ut
  indicant scripta Polemonis, quem Antiochus probat maxime, et Aristoteles
  eiusque amici nunc proxime videntur accedere. Introducebat etiam
  Carneades, non quo probaret, sed ut opponeret Stoicis, summum bonum esse
  frui rebus iis, quas primas natura conciliavisset. Honeste autem vivere,
  quod ducatur a conciliatione naturae, Zeno statuit finem esse bonorum,
  qui inventor et princeps Stoicorum fuit.</p>

  <p>XLIII. <a name="BkII_132"></a><a href="#BkIIN_132">132</a>. Iam illud
  perspicuum est, omnibus iis finibus bonorum, quos exposui, malorum finis
  esse contrarios. Ad vos nunc refero quem sequar: modo ne quis illud tam
  ineruditum absurdumque respondeat: 'Quemlibet, modo aliquem.' Nihil
  potest dici inconsideratius. Cupio sequi Stoicos. Licetne&mdash;omitto
  per Aristotelem, meo iudicio in philosophia prope singularem&mdash;per
  ipsum Antiochum? qui appellabatur Academicus, erat quidem, si perpauca
  mutavisset, germanissimus Stoicus. Erit igitur res iam in discrimine. Nam
  aut Stoicus constituatur sapiens aut veteris Academiae. Utrumque non
  potest. Est enim inter eos non de terminis, sed de tota possessione
  contentio. Nam omnis ratio vitae definitione summi boni continetur, de
  qua qui dissident, de omni vitae ratione dissident. Non potest igitur
  uterque sapiens esse, quoniam tanto opere dissentiunt, sed alter. Si
  Polemoneus, peccat Stoicus, rei falsae adsentiens&mdash;nam vos quidem
  nihil esse dicitis a sapiente tam alienum&mdash;: sin vera sunt Zenonis,
  eadem in veteres Academicos <i>et</i> Peripateticos dicenda. Hic igitur
  neutri adsentietur? Sin, inquam, uter est prudentior? <a
  name="BkII_133"></a><a href="#BkIIN_133">133</a>. Quid? cum ipse
  Antiochus dissentit quibusdam in rebus ab his, quos amat, Stoicis, nonne
  indicat non posse illa probanda esse sapienti? Placet Stoicis omnia
  peccata esse paria. At hoc Antiocho vehementissime displicet. Liceat
  tandem mihi considerare utram sententiam sequar. Praecide, inquit: statue
  aliquando quidlibet. Quid, quod quae dicuntur et acuta mihi videntur in
  utramque partem et paria? nonne caveam ne scelus faciam? Scelus enim
  dicebas esse, Luculle, dogma prodere. Contineo igitur me, ne incognito
  assentiar: quod mihi tecum est dogma commune. <a name="BkII_134"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_134">134</a>. Ecce multo maior etiam dissensio. Zeno in una
  virtute positam beatam vitam putat. Quid Antiochus? Etiam, inquit,
  beatam, sed non beatissimam. Deus ille, qui nihil censuit deesse virtuti,
  homuncio hic, qui multa putat praeter virtutem homini partim cara esse,
  partim etiam necessaria. Sed ille vereor ne virtuti plus tribuat quam
  natura patiatur, praesertim Theophrasto multa diserte copioseque dicente.
  Et hic metuo ne vix sibi constet, qui cum dicat esse quaedam et corporis
  et fortunae mala, tamen eum, qui in his omnibus sit, beatum fore censeat,
  si sapiens sit. Distrahor: tum hoc mihi probabilius, tum illud videtur,
  et tamen, nisi alterutrum sit, virtutem iacere plane puto. Verum in his
  discrepant.</p>

  <p>XLIV. <a name="BkII_135"></a><a href="#BkIIN_135">135</a>. Quid? illa,
  in quibus consentiunt, num pro veris probare possumus? Sapientis animum
  numquam nec cupiditate moveri nec laetitia efferri. Age, haec probabilia
  sane sint: num etiam illa, numquam timere, numquam dolere? Sapiensne non
  timeat, si patria deleatur? non doleat, si deleta sit? Durum, sed Zenoni
  necessarium, cui praeter honestum nihil est in bonis, tibi vero,
  Antioche, minime, cui praeter honestatem multa bona, praeter turpitudinem
  multa mala videntur, quae et venientia metuat sapiens necesse est et
  venisse doleat. Sed quaero quando ista fuerint <i>ab</i> Academia vetere
  decreta, ut animum sapientis commoveri et conturbari negarent?
  Mediocritates illi probabant et in omni permotione naturalem volebant
  esse quendam modum. Legimus omnes Crantoris veteris Academici de luctu.
  Est enim non magnus, verum aureolus et, ut Tuberoni Panaetius praecipit,
  ad verbum ediscendus libellus. Atque illi quidem etiam utiliter a natura
  dicebant permotiones istas animis nostris datas: metum cavendi causa,
  misericordiam aegritudinemque clementiae, ipsam iracundiam fortitudinis
  quasi cotem esse dicebant, recte secusne alias viderimus. <a
  name="BkII_136"></a><a href="#BkIIN_136">136</a>. Atrocitas quidem ista
  tua quo modo in veterem Academiam irruperit nescio: illa vero ferre non
  possum, non quo mihi displiceant: sunt enim Socratica pleraque mirabilia
  Stoicorum, quae <span lang="el" title="paradoxa"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3BE;&#x3B1;</span>
  nominantur, sed ubi Xenocrates, ubi Aristoteles ista tetigit? hos enim
  quasi eosdem esse voltis. Illi umquam dicerent sapientis solos reges,
  solos divites, solos formosos? omnia, quae ubique essent, sapientis esse?
  neminem consulem, praetorem, imperatorem, nescio an ne quinquevirum
  quidem quemquam nisi sapientem? postremo, solum civem, solum liberum?
  insipientis omnis peregrinos, exsules, servos, furiosos? denique scripta
  Lycurgi, Solonis, duodecim tabulas nostras non esse leges? ne urbis
  quidem aut civitatis, nisi quae essent sapientium? <a
  name="BkII_137"></a><a href="#BkIIN_137">137</a>. Haec tibi, Luculle, si
  es adsensus Antiocho, familiari tuo, tam sunt defendenda quam moenia:
  mihi autem bono modo, tantum quantum videbitur.</p>

  <p>XLV. Legi apud Clitomachum, cum Carneades et Stoicus Diogenes ad
  senatum in Capitolio starent, A. Albinum, qui tum P. Scipione et M.
  Marcello coss. praetor esset, eum, qui cum avo tuo, Luculle, consul fuit,
  doctum sane hominem, ut indicat ipsius historia scripta Graece, iocantem
  dixisse Carneadi: 'Ego tibi, Carneade, praetor esse non videor, quia
  sapiens non sum: nec haec urbs nec in ea civitas.' Tum ille: 'Huic Stoico
  non videris.' Aristoteles aut Xenocrates, quos Antiochus sequi volebat,
  non dubitavisset quin et praetor ille esset et Roma urbs et eam civitas
  incoleret. Sed ille noster est plane, ut supra dixi, Stoicus, perpauca
  balbutiens. <a name="BkII_138"></a><a href="#BkIIN_138">138</a>. Vos
  autem mihi veremini ne labar ad opinionem et aliquid asciscam et
  comprobem incognitum, quod minime voltis. Quid consilii datis? Testatur
  saepe Chrysippus tres solas esse sententias, quae defendi possint, de
  finibus bonorum: circumcidit et amputat multitudinem: aut enim honestatem
  esse finem aut voluptatem aut utrumque: nam qui summum bonum dicant id
  esse, si vacemus omni molestia, eos invidiosum nomen voluptatis fugere,
  sed in vicinitate versari, quod facere eos etiam, qui illud idem cum
  honestate coniungerent, nec multo secus eos, qui ad honestatem prima
  naturae commoda adiungerent: ita tres relinquit sententias, quas putat
  probabiliter posse defendi. <a name="BkII_139"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_139">139</a>. Sit sane ita&mdash;quamquam a Polemonis et
  Peripateticorum et Antiochi finibus non facile divellor, nec quicquam
  habeo adhuc probabilius&mdash;, verum tamen video quam suaviter voluptas
  sensibus nostris blandiatur. Labor eo, ut adsentiar Epicuro aut
  Aristippo. Revocat virtus vel potius reprehendit manu: pecudum illos
  motus esse dicit, hominem iungit deo. Possum esse medius, ut, quoniam
  Aristippus, quasi animum nullum habeamus, corpus solum tuetur, Zeno,
  quasi corporis simus expertes, animum solum complectitur, ut Calliphontem
  sequar, cuius quidem sententiam Carneades ita studiose defensitabat, ut
  eam probare etiam videretur. Quamquam Clitomachus adfirmabat numquam se
  intellegere potuisse quid Carneadi probaretur. Sed, si istum finem velim
  sequi, nonne ipsa veritas et gravis et recta ratio mihi obversetur? Tu,
  cum honestas in voluptate contemnenda consistat, honestatem cum voluptate
  tamquam hominem cum belua copulabis?</p>

  <p>XLVI. <a name="BkII_140"></a><a href="#BkIIN_140">140</a>. Unum igitur
  par quod depugnet reliquum est, voluptas cum honestate. De quo Chrysippo
  fuit, quantum ego sentio, non magna contentio. Alteram si sequare, multa
  ruunt et maxime communitas cum hominum genere, caritas, amicitia,
  iustitia, reliquae virtutes: quarum esse nulla potest, nisi erit
  gratuita. Nam quae voluptate quasi mercede aliqua ad officium impellitur,
  ea non est virtus, sed fallax imitatio simulatioque virtutis. Audi contra
  illos, qui nomen honestatis a se ne intellegi quidem dicant, nisi forte,
  quod gloriosum sit in volgus, id honestum velimus dicere: fontem omnium
  bonorum in corpore esse, hanc normam, hanc regulam, hanc praescriptionem
  esse naturae, a qua qui aberravisset, eum numquam quid in vita sequeretur
  habiturum. <a name="BkII_141"></a><a href="#BkIIN_141">141</a>. Nihil
  igitur me putatis, haec et alia innumerabilia cum audiam, moveri? Tam
  moveor quam tu, Luculle, neque me minus hominem quam te putaveris. Tantum
  interest, quod tu, cum es commotus, adquiescis, adsentiris, approbas,
  verum illud certum, comprehensum, perceptum, ratum, firmum, fixum esse
  vis, deque eo nulla ratione neque pelli neque moveri potes: ego nihil
  eius modi esse arbitror, cui si adsensus sim, non adsentiar saepe falso,
  quoniam vera a falsis nullo discrimine separantur, praesertim cum iudicia
  ista dialecticae nulla sint.</p>

  <p><a name="BkII_142"></a><a href="#BkIIN_142">142</a>. Venio enim iam ad
  tertiam partem philosophiae. Aliud iudicium Protagorae est, qui putet id
  cuique verum esse, quod cuique videatur: aliud Cyrenaicorum, qui praeter
  permotiones intimas nihil putant esse iudicii: aliud Epicuri, qui omne
  iudicium in sensibus et in rerum notitiis et in voluptate constituit.
  Plato autem omne iudicium veritatis veritatemque ipsam abductam ab
  opinionibus et a sensibus cogitationis ipsius et mentis esse voluit. <a
  name="BkII_143"></a><a href="#BkIIN_143">143</a>. Num quid horum probat
  noster Antiochus? Ille vero ne maiorum quidem suorum. Ubi enim aut
  Xenocratem sequitur, cuius libri sunt de ratione loquendi multi et multum
  probati, aut ipsum Aristotelem, quo profecto nihil est acutius, nihil
  politius? A Chrysippo pedem nusquam.</p>

  <p>XLVII. Quid ergo Academici appellamur? an abutimur gloria nominis? aut
  cur cogimur eos sequi, qui inter se dissident? In hoc ipso, quod in
  elementis dialectici docent, quo modo iudicare oporteat verum falsumne
  sit, si quid ita conexum est, ut hoc, 'si dies est, lucet,' quanta
  contentio est! Aliter Diodoro, aliter Philoni, Chrysippo aliter placet.
  Quid? cum Cleanthe doctore suo quam multis rebus Chrysippus dissidet!
  quid? duo vel principes dialecticorum, Antipater et Archidemus,
  opiniosissimi homines, nonne multis in rebus dissentiunt? <a
  name="BkII_144"></a><a href="#BkIIN_144">144</a>. Quid me igitur,
  Luculle, in invidiam et tamquam in contionem vocas? et quidem, ut
  seditiosi tribuni solent, occludi tabernas iubes? quo enim spectat illud,
  cum artificia tolli quereris a nobis, nisi ut opifices concitentur? qui
  si undique omnes convenerint, facile contra vos incitabuntur. Expromam
  primum illa invidiosa, quod eos omnis, qui in contione stabunt, exsules,
  servos, insanos esse dicatis: deinde ad illa veniam, quae iam non ad
  multitudinem, sed ad vosmet ipsos, qui adestis, pertinent. Negat enim vos
  Zeno, negat Antiochus scire quicquam. Quo modo? inquies: nos enim
  defendimus etiam insipientem multa comprehendere. <a
  name="BkII_145"></a><a href="#BkIIN_145">145</a>. At scire negatis
  quemquam rem ullam nisi sapientem. Et hoc quidem Zeno gestu conficiebat.
  Nam, cum extensis digitis adversam manum ostenderat, 'visum,' inquiebat,
  'huius modi est.' Deinde, cum paulum digitos contraxerat, 'adsensus huius
  modi.' Tum cum plane compresserat pugnumque fecerat, comprehensionem
  illam esse dicebat: qua ex similitudine etiam nomen ei rei, quod ante non
  fuerat, <span lang="el" title="katalêpsin"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C8;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>
  imposuit. Cum autem laevam manum adverterat et illum pugnum arte
  vehementerque compresserat, scientiam talem esse dicebat, cuius compotem
  nisi sapientem esse neminem. Sed qui sapientes sint aut fuerint ne ipsi
  quidem solent dicere. Ita tu nunc, Catule, lucere nescis nec tu,
  Hortensi, in tua villa nos esse. <a name="BkII_146"></a><a
  href="#BkIIN_146">146</a>. Num minus haec invidiose dicuntur? nec tamen
  nimis eleganter: illa subtilius. Sed quo modo tu, si nihil comprehendi
  posset, artificia concidere dicebas neque mihi dabas id, quod probabile
  esset, satis magnam vim habere ad artis, sic ego nunc tibi refero artem
  sine scientia esse non posse. An pateretur hoc Zeuxis aut Phidias aut
  Polyclitus, nihil se scire, cum in iis esset tanta sollertia? Quod si eos
  docuisset aliquis quam vim habere diceretur scientia, desinerent irasci:
  ne nobis quidem suscenserent, cum didicissent id tollere nos, quod
  nusquam esset, quod autem satis esset ipsis relinquere. Quam rationem
  maiorum etiam comprobat diligentia, qui primum iurare 'ex sui animi
  sententia' quemque voluerunt, deinde ita teneri 'si sciens falleret,'
  quod inscientia multa versaretur in vita, tum, qui testimonium diceret,
  ut 'arbitrari' se diceret etiam quod ipse vidisset, quaeque iurati
  iudices cognovissent, ea non ut esse facta, sed ut 'videri'
  pronuntiarentur.</p>

  <p>XLVIII. <a name="BkII_147"></a><a href="#BkIIN_147">147</a>. Verum,
  quoniam non solum nauta significat, sed etiam Favonius ipse insusurrat
  navigandi nobis, Luculle, tempus esse et quoniam satis multa dixi, est
  mihi perorandum. Posthac tamen, cum haec quaeremus, potius de
  dissensionibus tantis summorum virorum disseramus, de obscuritate naturae
  deque errore tot philosophorum, qui de bonis contrariisque rebus tanto
  opere discrepant, ut, cum plus uno verum esse non possit, iacere necesse
  sit tot tam nobilis disciplinas, quam de oculorum sensuumque reliquorum
  mendaciis et de sorite aut pseudomeno, quas plagas ipsi contra se Stoici
  texuerunt. <a name="BkII_148"></a><a href="#BkIIN_148">148</a>. Tum
  Lucullus: Non moleste, inquit, fero nos haec contulisse. Saepius enim
  congredientes nos, et maxime in Tusculanis nostris, si quae videbuntur,
  requiremus. Optime, inquam, sed quid Catulus sentit? quid Hortensius? Tum
  Catulus: Egone? inquit, ad patris revolvor sententiam, quam quidem ille
  Carneadeam esse dicebat, ut percipi nihil putem posse, adsensurum autem
  non percepto, id est, opinaturum sapientem existimem, sed ita, ut
  intellegat se opinari sciatque nihil esse quod comprehendi et percipi
  possit: qua re <span lang="el" title="epochên"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C7;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;</span> illam omnium rerum non
  probans, illi alteri sententiae, nihil esse quod percipi possit,
  vehementer adsentior. Habeo, inquam, sententiam tuam nec eam admodum
  aspernor. Sed tibi quid tandem videtur, Hortensi? Tum ille ridens:
  Tollendum. Teneo te, inquam: nam ista Academiae est propria sententia.
  Ita sermone confecto Catulus remansit: nos ad naviculas nostras
  descendimus.</p>

<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>BOOK I.</h3>

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkI_1">§§1</a>&mdash;<a
  href="#BkI_14">14</a></b>. Summary. Cic., Varro and Atticus meet at Cumae
  (<a href="#BkI_1">1</a>). Cic., after adroitly reminding Varro that the
  promised dedication of the <i>De Lingua Latina</i> is too long delayed,
  turns the conversation towards philosophy, by asking Varro why he leaves
  this subject untouched (<a href="#BkI_2">2</a>, <a href="#BkI_3">3</a>).
  Varro thinks philosophy written in Latin can serve no useful purpose, and
  points to the failures of the Roman Epicureans (<a
  href="#BkI_4">4</a>&mdash;<a href="#BkI_6">6</a>). He greatly believes in
  philosophy, but prefers to send his friends to Greece for it, while he
  devotes himself to subjects which the Greeks have not treated (<a
  href="#BkI_7">7</a>, <a href="#BkI_8">8</a>). Cic. lauds this devotion,
  but demurs to the theory that philosophy written in Latin is useless.
  Latins may surely imitate Greek philosophers as well as Greek poets and
  orators. He gives reasons why he should himself make the attempt, and
  instancing the success of Brutus, again begs Varro to write on philosophy
  (<a href="#BkI_9">9</a>&mdash;<a href="#BkI_12">12</a>). Varro putting
  the request on one side charges Cic. with deserting the Old Academy for
  the New. Cic. defends himself, and appeals to Philo for the statement
  that the New Academy is in harmony with the Old. Varro refers to
  Antiochus as an authority on the other side. This leads to a proposal on
  the part of Cic. to discuss thoroughly the difference between Antiochus
  and Philo. Varro agrees, and promises an exposition of the principles of
  Antiochus (<a href="#BkI_13">13</a>, <a
  href="#BkI_14">14</a>).</blockquote>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_1"></a><a href="#BkI_1">§1</a></b>. <i>Noster</i>:
  our common friend. Varro was much more the friend of Atticus than of
  Cic., see Introd. p. <a href="#Page_xxxvii">37</a>. <i>Nuntiatum</i>: the
  spelling <i>nunciatum</i> is a mistake, cf. Corssen, <i>Ausspr.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> p. 51. <i>A M. Varrone</i>: <i>from M. Varro's
  house</i> news came. <i>Audissemus</i>: Cic. uses the contracted forms of
  such subjunctives, as well as the full forms, but not intermediate forms
  like <i>audiissemus</i>. <i>Confestim</i>: note how artfully Cic. uses
  the dramatic form of the dialogue in order to magnify his attachment for
  Varro. <i>Ab eius villa</i>: the prep is absent from the MSS., but
  Wesenberg (<i>Em. M.T. Cic. Epistolarum</i>, p. 62) shows that it must be
  inserted. Cic. writes <i>abesse Roma</i> (<i>Ad Fam.</i> <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 15, 4), <i>patria</i> (<i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 106) etc., but not <i>abesse officio</i> (<i>De
  Off.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 43, where Wes. alters it) or the
  like. <i>Satis eum longo intervallo</i>: so all the MSS.; but Halm, after
  Davies, reads <i>se visentum</i> for <i>satis eum</i>, quoting <i>Ad
  Att.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 4, Madv. <i>tum</i> for <i>eum</i>
  (Baiter and Halm's ed. of 1861, p. 854). The text is sound; the
  repetition of pronouns (<i>illum</i>, <i>eum</i>) is quite Ciceronian.
  The emphatic <i>ille</i> is often repeated by the unemphatic <i>is</i>,
  cf. <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 71, and <i>M.D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 22. I may note that the separation of <i>satis</i>
  from <i>longo</i> by the word <i>eum</i> is quite in Cicero's style (see
  my note on <a href="#BkIN_25">25</a> <i>quanta id magis</i>). Some
  editors stumble (Goerenz miserably) by taking <i>intervallo</i> of
  distance in space, instead of duration in time, while others wrongly
  press <i>satis</i>, which only means "tolerably," to mean "sufficiently."
  The words <i>satis longo intervallo</i> simply = "after a tolerably long
  halt." For the clause <i>ut mos</i>, etc., cf. <i>De Or.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 13.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_2"></a><a href="#BkI_2">§2</a></b>. <i>Hic pauca
  primo</i>: for the omission of <i>locuti</i>, cf. the very similar
  passages in <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 14, <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 8, also my note on <a href="#BkIN_14">14</a>.
  <i>Atque ea</i>: Halm brackets <i>ea</i>, quite needlessly, for its
  insertion is like Cic. <i>Ecquid forte Roma novi</i>: <i>Roma</i> is the
  ablative, and some verb like <i>attulisset</i> is omitted. (So Turnebus.)
  To take it as nom., understanding <i>faciat</i>, is clearly wrong.
  <i>Percontari</i>: the spelling <i>percunctari</i> rests on false
  derivation (Corss. <span class="vol">I.</span> 36). <i>Ecquid ipse
  novi</i>: cf. <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 13. The MSS.
  have <i>et si quid</i>, bad Latin altered by Manutius. <i>Istum</i>: some
  edd. <i>ipsum</i>, but Cic. often makes a speaker use <i>iste</i> of a
  person who is present. Goer. qu. <i>Brut.</i> 125, <i>De Or.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 228. <i>Velit</i>: Walker reads <i>velis</i> with
  St Jerome. For <i>quod velit</i> = <i>quod quis velit</i>, cf. <i>De
  Or.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 30. <i>In manibus</i>: so often, cf.
  <i>Cat. Mai.</i> 38. <i>Idque</i>: MSS. have in the place of this
  <i>quod</i> with variants <i>que</i>, <i>quae</i>, <i>qui</i>,
  <i>quo</i>. Dav. gave <i>quia</i>, which was the vulgate reading down to
  Halm, who reads <i>idque</i>, after Christ. <i>Ad hunc enim ipsum</i>:
  MSS. have <i>eum</i> for <i>enim</i> (exc. Halm's G). Such a combination
  of pronouns is vainly defended by Goer.; for expressions like <i>me illum
  ipsum</i> (<i>Ad Att.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 1, 11) are not in
  point. Of course if <i>quia</i> be read above, <i>eum</i> must be ejected
  altogether. <i>Quaedam institui</i>: the <i>De Lingua Latina</i>; see
  <i>Ad. Att</i> <span class="vol">XIII.</span> 12.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_3"></a><a href="#BkI_3">§3</a></b>. <i>E Libone</i>:
  the father-in-law of Sext. Pompeius; see Cæsar <i>B. Civ.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 5, 16, 24. <i>Nihil enim eius modi</i> again all
  MSS. except Halm's G. have <i>eum</i> for <i>enim</i>. Christ conj.
  <i>enim eum</i>; so Baiter. <i>Illud ... requirere</i>: i.e. the question
  which follows; cf. <i>requiris</i> in <a href="#BkI_4">4</a>. <i>Tecum
  simul</i>: Halm's G om. <i>tecum</i>; but cf. <i>De Or.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 330. <i>Mandare monumentis&mdash;letteris
  illustrare</i>: common phrases in Cic., e.g. <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 1, <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 1, <i>De
  Div.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 4. <i>Monumentis</i>: this, and not
  <i>monimentis</i> (Halm) or <i>monementis</i>, is probably the right
  spelling; cf. Corss. <span class="vol">II.</span> 314. <i>Ortam a</i>:
  Cic. <i>always</i> writes the prep. after <i>ortus</i>; cf. <i>M.D.F.</i>
  <span class="vol">V.</span> 69. <i>Genus</i>: regularly used by Cic. as
  <i>opus</i> by Quintilian to mean "department of literature." <i>Ea
  res</i>: one of Halm's MSS. followed by Baiter has <i>ars</i>; on the
  other hand Bentley (if the <i>amicus</i> so often quoted in Davies' notes
  be really he) reads <i>artibus</i> for <i>rebus</i> below. The slight
  variation, however, from <i>res</i> to <i>artibus</i> is such as Cic.
  loves. <i>Ceteris</i>: the spelling <i>caeteris</i> (Klotz) is absolutely
  wrong, cf. Corss. <span class="vol">I.</span> 325. <i>Antecedat</i>: some
  MSS. give <i>antecellat</i>. a frequent variant, cf. <i>De Off.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 105</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_4"></a><a href="#BkI_4">§4</a>.</b>
  <i>Deliberatam&mdash;agitatam</i>: Cic. as usual exaggerates the
  knowledge possessed by the <i>personae</i> of the dialogue; cf. Introd.
  p. <a href="#Page_xxxviii">38</a>, <i>De Or.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 1. <i>In promptu</i>: so <span
  class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_10">10</a>. <i>Quod ista ipsa ...
  cogitavi</i>: Goer., who half a page back had made merry over the gloss
  hunters, here himself scented a miserable gloss; Schutz, Goerenz's echo
  expels the words. Yet they are thoroughly like Cic. (cf. <i>De Div.</i>
  <span class="vol">II.</span> 1, <i>Cat. Mai.</i> 38), and moreover
  nothing is more Ciceronian than the repetition of words and clauses in
  slightly altered forms. The reason here is partly the intense desire to
  flatter Varro. <i>Si qui ... si essent</i>: the first <i>si</i> has
  really no conditional force, <i>si qui</i> like <span lang="el"
  title="eitines" >&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;&#x3B5;&#x3C2;</span>
  merely means "all who," for a strong instance see <i>Ad Fam.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 9, 13, ed Nobbe, <i>si accusandi sunt, si qui
  pertimuerunt</i>. <i>Ea nolui scribere</i>, etc.: very similar
  expressions occur in the prologue to <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span>, which should be compared with this prologue
  throughout.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_5"></a><a href="#BkI_5">§5</a>.</b> <i>Vides ...
  didicisti</i>: MSS. have <i>vides autem eadem ipse didicisti enim</i>. My
  reading is that of Dav. followed by Baiter. Halm, after Christ, has
  <i>vides autem ipse&mdash;didicisti enim eadem&mdash;non posse</i>, etc.
  <i>Similis</i>: Halm, in deference to MSS., makes Cic. write <i>i</i> and
  <i>e</i> indiscriminately in the acc. plur. of i stems. I shall write
  <i>i</i> everywhere, we shall thus, I believe, be far nearer Cicero's
  real writing. Though I do not presume to say that his usage did not vary,
  he must in the vast majority of instances have written <i>i</i>, see
  Corss. <span class="vol">I.</span> 738&mdash;744. <i>Amafinii aut
  Rabirii</i>: cf. Introd. p. <a href="#Page_xxvi">26</a>. <i>Definiunt ...
  partiuntur</i>: n. on <a href="#BkIN_32">32</a>. <i>Interrogatione</i>:
  Faber saw this to be right, but a number of later scholars alter it, e.g.
  Bentl. <i>argumentatione</i>, Ernesti <i>ratione</i>. But the word as it
  stands has exactly the meaning these alterations are intended to secure.
  <i>Interrogatio</i> is merely the <i>conclusio</i> or syllogism put as a
  series of questions. Cf. <i>Paradoxa</i> 2, with <i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 42 which will show that <i>interrogatiuncula</i>
  and <i>conclusiuncula</i> are almost convertible terms. See also
  <i>M.D.F.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 39. <i>Nec dicendi nec
  disserendi</i>: Cic.'s constant mode of denoting the Greek <span
  lang="el" title="rhêtorikê"
  >&#x201B;&#x3C1;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;</span>
  and <span lang="el" title="dialektikê"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3BA;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;</span>;
  note on <a href="#BkIN_32">32</a>. <i>Et oratorum etiam</i>: Man., Lamb.
  om. <i>etiam</i>, needlessly. In <i>Ad Fam.</i> <span
  class="vol">IX.</span> 25, 3, the two words even occur without any other
  word to separate them. For <i>oratorum</i> Pearce conj. <i>rhetorum</i>.
  <i>Rhetor</i>, however is not thus used in Cic.'s phil. works.
  <i>Utramque vim virtutem</i>: strange that Baiter (esp. after Halm's
  note) should take Manutius' far-fetched conj. <i>unam</i> for
  <i>virtutem</i>. Any power or faculty (vis, <span lang="el"
  title="dynamis"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3C5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>) may be called
  in Gk. <span lang="el" title="aretê"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;</span>, in Lat <i>virtus</i>. Two
  passages, <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 72, <i>De Or.</i>
  <span class="vol">III.</span> 65, will remove all suspicion from the
  text. <i>Verbis quoque novis</i>: MSS. have <i>quanquam</i> which however
  is impossible in such a place in Cic. (cf. <i>M.D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 68). <i>Ne a nobis quidem</i>: so all the MSS., but
  Orelli (after Ernesti) thinking the phrase "<i>arrogantius dictum</i>"
  places <i>quidem</i> after <i>accipient</i>. The text is quite right,
  <i>ne quidem</i>, as Halm remarks, implies no more than the Germ. <i>auch
  nicht</i>, cf. also Gk. <span lang="el" title="oude"
  >&#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;</span>. <i>Suscipiatur labor</i>: MSS. om.
  the noun, but it is added by a later hand in G.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_6"></a><a href="#BkI_6">§6</a>.</b> <i>Epicurum, id
  est si Democritum</i>: for the charge see <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 17, <span class="vol">IV.</span> 13, <i>N.D.</i>
  <span class="vol">I.</span> 73. <i>Id est</i> often introduces in Cic. a
  clause which intensifies and does not merely explain the first clause,
  exx. in <i>M.D.F.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 33. <i>Cum causas rerum
  efficientium sustuleris</i>: cf. <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span>
  18, the same charge is brought by Aristotle against the Atomists,
  <i>Met.</i> A, 2. Many editors from Lamb. to Halm and Baiter read
  <i>efficientis</i>, which would then govern <i>rerum</i> (cf. <i>D.F.</i>
  <span class="vol">V.</span> 81, <i>De Fato</i>, 33, also Gk. <span
  lang="el" title="poiêtikos"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3B7;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>).
  But the genitive is merely one of definition, the <i>causae</i> are the
  <i>res efficientes</i>, for which cf. <a href="#BkI_24">24</a> and
  <i>Topica</i>, 58, <i>proximus locus est rerum efficientium, quae causae
  appellantur</i>. So Faber, though less fully. <i>Appellat</i>: i.e.
  Amafinius, who first so translated <span lang="el" title="atomos"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>. <i>Quae cum
  contineantur</i>: this reading has far the best MSS. authority, it must
  be kept, and <i>adhibenda etiam</i> begins the <i>apodosis</i>. Madvig
  (<i>Emendationes ad Ciceronis Libros Philosophicos</i>, Hauniae, 1825, p.
  108) tacitly reads <i>continentur</i> without <i>cum</i>, so Orelli and
  Klotz. Goer. absurdly tries to prop up the subj. without <i>cum</i>.
  <i>Quam quibusnam</i>: Durand's em. for <i>quoniam quibusnam</i> of the
  MSS., given by Halm and also Baiter. Madv. (<i>Em.</i> p. 108) made a
  forced defence of <i>quoniam</i>, as marking a rapid transition from one
  subject to another (here from physics to ethics) like the Gk. <span
  lang="el" title="epei" >&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;</span>, only one
  parallel instance, however, was adduced (<i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 14) and the usage probably is not Latin.
  <i>Adducere?</i>: The note of interrogation is Halm's; thus the whole
  sentence, so far, explains the difficulty of setting forth the true
  system of physics. If <i>quoniam</i> is read and no break made at
  <i>adducere</i>, all after <i>quoniam</i> will refer to ethics, in that
  case there will be a strange change of subject in passing from
  <i>quisquam</i> to <i>haec ipsa</i>, both which expressions will be
  nominatives to <i>poterit</i>, further, there will be the almost
  impossible ellipse of <i>ars</i>, <i>scientia</i>, or something of the
  kind after <i>haec ipsa</i>. On every ground the reading of Madv. is
  insupportable. <i>Quid, haec ipsa</i>: I have added <i>quid</i> to fill
  up the lacuna left by Halm, who supposes much more to have fallen out.

  elucidated later. For the Epicurean ignorance of geometry see note on

  opinion often denounced by Cic., see esp <i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 41, where Cic.'s Latin agrees very closely with
  the Greek preserved by Diog. Laert. <span class="vol">X.</span> 6 (qu.
  Zeller, 451), and less accurately by Athenaeus, <span
  class="vol">VII.</span> 279 (qu. R. and P. 353). <i>Ne suspicari
  quidem</i>: for this MSS. give <i>nec suspicari</i>, but Madv.
  (<i>D.F.</i>, Excursus <span class="vol">III.</span>) has conclusively
  shown that <i>nec</i> for <i>ne ... quidem</i> is post Augustan Latin.
  Christ supposes some thing like <i>sentire</i> to have fallen out before
  <i>nec suspicari</i>; that this is wrong is clear from the fact that in
  <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 20, 30, <i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 46, <i>N.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 111,
  where the same opinion of Epicurus is dealt with, we have either <i>ne
  suspicari quidem</i> or <i>ne intellegere quidem</i> (cf. also <i>In
  Pisonem</i> 69). Further, <i>ne ... quidem</i> is esp frequent with
  <i>suspicari</i> (<i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 20), and verbs
  of the kind (<i>cogitari</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> <a
  href="#BkII_82">82</a>), and especially, as Durand remarked, at the end
  of sentences eg <i>Verr.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 1, 155. Notice
  <i>negat ... ne suspicari quidem</i> without <i>se</i>, which however
  Baiter inserts, in spite of the numerous passages produced from Cic. by
  Madv. (<i>Em.</i> 111), in which not only <i>se</i>, but <i>me</i>,
  <i>nos</i>, and other accusatives of pronouns are omitted before the
  infinitive, after verbs like <i>negat</i>. Cf. also the omission of
  <i>sibi</i> in <i>Paradoxa</i> 40. <i>Si vero</i>: this, following
  <i>sive enim</i> above, is a departure from Cic.'s rule which is to write
  <i>sive&mdash;sive</i> or <i>si&mdash;sin</i>, but not
  <i>si&mdash;sive</i> or <i>sive&mdash;si</i>. This and two or three other
  similar passages in Cic. are explained as anacolutha by Madv. in a most
  important and exhaustive excursus to his <i>D.F.</i> (p. 785, ed. 2), and
  are connected with other instances of broken sequence. There is no need
  therefore to read <i>sive</i> here, as did Turn. Lamb. Dav. and others.
  <i>Quam nos ... probamus</i>: cf. Introd. p. <a href="#Page_lxii">62</a>.
  <i>Erit explicanda</i>: for the separation of these words by other words
  interposed, which is characteristic of Cic., see <a
  href="#BkI_11">11</a>, <a href="#BkI_17">17</a>. I am surprised that Halm
  and Baiter both follow Ernesti in his hypercritical objection to the
  phrase <i>explicare Academiam</i>, and read <i>erunt</i> against the
  MSS., making <i>illa</i> plural. If <i>erunt</i> is read, <i>erit</i>
  must be supplied from it to go with <i>disserendum</i>, which is harsh.
  <i>Quam argute, quam obscure</i>: at first sight an oxymoron, but
  <i>argute</i> need not only imply <i>clearness</i>, it means merely
  "acutely". <i>Quantum possum</i>: some MSS. have <i>quantam</i>, which is
  scarcely Latin, since in Cic. an accusative only follows <i>nequeo</i>,
  <i>volo</i>, <i>malo</i>, <i>possum</i>, and such verbs when an
  infinitive can be readily supplied to govern it. For <i>velle</i> see a
  good instance in <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 68, where
  consult Madv. <i>Constantiam</i>: the notions of firmness, consistency,
  and clearness of mind are bound up in this word, cf. <span
  class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_53">53</a>. <i>Apud Platonem</i>:
  <i>Timaeus</i>, 47 B, often quoted or imitated by Cic., cf. <i>De
  Leg.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 58, <i>Laelius</i> 20, 47,
  <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 64.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_8"></a><a href="#BkI_8">§8</a>.</b> <i>Id est ...
  jubeo</i>: these words have been naturally supposed a gloss. But Cicero
  is nothing if not tautological; he is fond of placing slight variations
  in phrase side by side. See some remarkable instances of slightly varied
  phrases connected by <i>id est</i> in <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 72, <span class="vol">II.</span> 6, 90. I therefore
  hold Halm and Baiter to be wrong in bracketing the words. <i>Ea a</i>:
  Lamb., objecting to the sound (which is indeed not like Cic.), would read
  <i>e</i> for <i>a</i>, which Halm would also prefer. <i>De</i>,
  <i>ab</i>, and <i>ex</i> follow <i>haurire</i> indifferently in Cic.
  <i>Rivulos consectentur</i>: so Wordsworth, "to hunt the waterfalls". The
  metaphor involved in <i>fontibus&mdash;rivulos</i> is often applied by
  Cic. to philosophy, see esp. a sarcastic passage about Epicurus in
  <i>N.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 120. <i>Nihil enim magno
  opere</i>: <i>magno opere</i> should be written in two words, not as
  <i>magnopere</i>, cf. the phrases <i>maximo opere</i>, <i>nimio
  opere</i>, the same holds good of <i>tanto opere</i>, <i>quanto
  opere</i>. <i>L. Aelii</i>: MSS. <i>Laelii</i>. The person meant is L.
  Aelius Stilo or Praeconinus, the master of Varro, and the earliest
  systematic grammarian of Rome. See Quintil. <i>Inst. Or.</i> <span
  class="vol">X.</span> 1, 99, Gellius <span class="vol">X.</span> 21,
  Sueton. <i>Gramm.</i> 3. <i>Occasum</i>: an unusual metaphor.
  <i>Menippum</i>: a Cynic satirist, see <i>Dict. Biogr.</i> Considerable
  fragments of Varro's Menippean Satires remain, and have often been
  edited&mdash;most recently by Riese (published by Teubner). <i>Imitati
  non interpretati</i>: Cic. <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 7,
  gives his opinion as to the right use to be made of Greek models.
  <i>&#x2020;Quae quo</i>: these words are evidently wrong. Halm after
  Faber ejects <i>quae</i>, and is followed by Baiter. Varro is thus made
  to say that he stated many things dialectically, <i>in order that</i> the
  populace might be enticed to read. To my mind the fault lies in the word
  <i>quo</i>, for which I should prefer to read <i>cum</i> (=<i>quom</i>,
  which would be written <i>qu&#333;</i> in the MSS.) The general sense
  would then be "Having introduced philosophy into that kind of literature
  which the unlearned read, I proceeded to introduce it into that which the
  learned read." <i>Laudationibus</i>: <span lang="el" title="logois epitaphiois"

  cf. <i>Ad Att.</i> <span class="vol">XIII.</span> 48 where Varro's are
  mentioned. <i>&#x2020;Philosophe scribere</i>: the MSS. all give
  <i>philosophie</i>. Klotz has <i>philosophiam</i>, which is demonstrably
  wrong, <i>physica</i>, <i>musica</i> etc. <i>scribere</i> may be said,
  but not <i>physicam</i>, <i>musicam</i> etc. <i>scribere</i>. The one
  passage formerly quoted to justify the phrase <i>philosophiam
  scribere</i> is now altered in the best texts (<i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 121, where see Tischer). Goer. reads
  <i>philosophiae scribere</i>; his explanation is, as Orelli gently says,
  "vix Latina." I can scarcely think Halm's <i>philosophe</i> to be right,
  the word occurs nowhere else, and Cic. almost condemns it by his use of
  the Greek <span lang="el" title="philosophôs"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3C9;&#x3C2;</span>
  (<i>Ad Att.</i> <span class="vol">XIII.</span> 20). In older Greek the
  adverb does not appear, nor is <span lang="el" title="philosophos"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>
  used as an adjective much, yet Cic. uses <i>philosophus</i> adjectivally
  in <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span> 121, <i>Cat. Mai.</i> 22,
  <i>N.D.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 23, just as he uses
  <i>tyrannus</i> (<i>De Rep.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 45), and
  <i>anapaestus</i> (<i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 57) Might we
  not read <i>philosophis</i>, in the dative, which only requires the
  alteration of a single letter from the MSS. reading? The meaning would
  then be "to write <i>for</i> philosophers," which would agree with my
  emendation <i>cum</i> for <i>quo</i> above. <i>Philosophice</i> would be
  a tempting alteration, but that the word <span lang="el"
  title="philosophikos"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>
  is not Greek, nor do <i>philosophicus</i>, <i>philosophice</i> occur till
  very late Latin times. <i>Si modo id consecuti sumus</i>: cf.

  6. Some edd. have <i>sint</i>, which is unlikely to be right. <i>Nos in

  quotes this with the reading <i>reduxerunt</i> for <i>deduxerunt</i>,
  which is taken by Baiter and by Halm; who quotes with approval Durand's
  remark, "<i>deducimus honoris causa sed errantes reducimus
  humanitatis</i>." The words, however, are almost convertible; see <i>Cat.
  Mai.</i> 63. In <i>Lael.</i> 12, <i>Brut.</i> 86, we have
  <i>reducere</i>, where Durand's rule requires <i>deducere</i>, on the
  other hand cf. <i>Ad Herennium</i> <span class="vol">IV.</span> 64,
  <i>hospites domum deducere. Aetatem patriae</i> etc., August. (<i>De Civ.
  Dei</i> <span class="vol">VI.</span> 3) describes Varro's "<i>Libri
  Antiquitatum</i>" (referred to in <a href="#BkI_8">8</a>), in which most
  of the subjects here mentioned were treated of. <i>Descriptiones

  for dates, Thuc. <span class="vol">V.</span> 20, etc. <i>Tu
  sacerdotum</i>: after this Lamb. inserts <i>munera</i> to keep the
  balance of the clauses. Cic. however is quite as fond of variety as of
  formal accuracy. <i>Domesticam&mdash;bellicam</i>: opposed like <i>domi
  bellique</i>, cf. <i>Brut.</i> 49, <i>De Off.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 74. Augustine's reading <i>publicam</i> shows him
  to have been quoting from memory. <i>Sedem</i>: so the best MSS. of Aug.,
  some edd. here give <i>sedium</i>. The argument for <i>sedem</i> is the
  awkwardness of making the three genitives, <i>sedium</i>,
  <i>regionum</i>, <i>locorum</i>, dependent on the accusatives,
  <i>nomina</i>, <i>genera</i>, <i>officia</i>, <i>causas</i>. Cic. is fond
  of using <i>sedes</i>, <i>locus</i>, <i>regio</i> together, see <i>Pro
  Murena</i>, 85, <i>Pro Cluentio</i>, 171, quoted by Goer. <i>Omnium
  divinarum humanarumque rerum</i>: from the frequent references of Aug. it
  appears that the "<i>Libri Antiquitatum</i>" were divided into two parts,
  one treating of <i>res humanae</i>, the other of <i>res divinae</i>
  (<i>De Civ. Dei</i>, <span class="vol">IV.</span> 1, 27, <span

  <i>Probabilem</i>: = specious. <i>Nesciunt</i>: Halm with his one MS. G,
  which is the work of a clever emendator, gives <i>nescient</i> to suit
  <i>malent</i> above, and is followed by Baiter. It is not necessary to
  force on Cic. this formally accurate sequence of tenses, which Halm
  himself allows to be broken in two similar passages, <span

  <i>sed eam mihi non satis probas</i>, which is too far from the MSS. to
  please me. The text as it stands is not intolerable, though <i>da
  mihi</i> for <i>dic mihi</i> is certainly poetic. <i>Da te mihi</i>
  (Manut., Goer., Orelli) is far too strong for the passage, and cannot be
  supported by <a href="#BkI_12">12</a>, <i>Brut.</i> 306, <i>Ad Fam.</i>

  the same praise often recurs in <i>D.F.</i> and the <i>Brutus Graecia
  desideret</i> so all Halm's MSS., except G, which has <i>Graeca</i>. Halm
  (and after him Baiter) adopts the conj. of Aldus the younger, <i>Graeca
  desideres</i>. A reviewer of Halm, in Schneidewin's <i>Philologus</i>
  <span class="vol">XXIV.</span> 483, approves the reading on the curious
  ground that Brutus was not anxious to satisfy Greek requirements, but
  rather to render it unnecessary for Romans to have recourse to Greece for
  philosophy. I keep the MSS. reading, for Greece with Cicero is the
  supreme arbiter of performance in philosophy, if she is satisfied the
  philosophic world is tranquil. Cf. <i>Ad Att.</i> <span

  <i>illam</i>. The position of <i>iam</i> would be strange, in the passage
  which used to be compared, <i>Pro Cluentio</i> 16, Classen and Baiter now
  om. the word. Further, <i>vetus</i> and <i>nova</i> can scarcely be so
  barely used to denote the Old and the New Academy. The reading
  <i>illam</i> is from Madv. (<i>Em.</i> 115), and is supported by <i>illam
  veterem</i> (<a href="#BkI_18">18</a>), <i>illa antiqua</i> (<a

  class="vol">V.</span> 8), and similar uses. Bentl. (followed by Halm and
  Bait.) thinks <i>iam</i> comprises the last two syllables of
  <i>Academiam</i>, which he reads. <i>Correcta et emendata</i>: a fine
  sentiment to come from a conservative like Cic. The words often occur
  together and illustrate Cic.'s love for small diversities of expression,
  cf. <i>De Leg.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 30, <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">IV.</span> 21, also Tac. <i>Hist.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 37. <i>Negat</i>: MSS. have <i>negaret</i>, but
  Cic. never writes the subj. after <i>quamquam</i> in <i>oratio recta</i>,
  as Tac. does, unless there is some conditional or potential force in the
  sentence; see <i>M.D.F.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 70. Nothing is
  commoner in the MSS. than the substitution of the imp. subj. for the
  pres. ind. of verbs of the first conjug. and <i>vice versa</i>. <i>In

  <i>Duas Academias</i>: for the various modes of dividing the Academy
  refer to R. and P. 404. <i>Contra ea Philonis</i>: MSS. have <i>contra

  <i>Philonem</i>, as does the ed. Rom. (1471). I have added <i>ea</i>.
  Orelli quotes <i>Ad Att.</i> <span class="vol">XII.</span> 23, 2, <i>ex
  Apollodori</i>. Possibly the MSS. may be right, and <i>libros</i> may be
  supplied from <i>libris</i> above, so in <i>Ad Att.</i> <span

  &#x3C8;&#x3C5;&#x3C7;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span> <i>utrosque</i>, the word
  <i>libros</i> has to be supplied from the preceding letter, cf. a similar
  ellipse of <i>bona</i> in <a href="#BkI_19">19</a>, <a
  href="#BkI_22">22</a>. Madvig's <i>Philonia</i> is improbable from its
  non-appearance elsewhere, while the companion adjective <i>Antiochius</i>
  is frequent. Halm inserts <i>sententiam</i>, a heroic remedy. To make
  <i>contra</i> an adv. and construe <i>Philonis Antiochus</i> together,
  supplying <i>auditor</i>, as is done by some unknown commentators who
  probably only exist in Goerenz's note, is wild, and cannot be justified

  Manut. <i>Renovari</i>: the vulg. <i>revocari</i> is a curious instance
  of oversight. It crept into the text of Goer. by mistake, for in his note
  he gave <i>renovari</i>. Orelli&mdash;who speaks of Goerenz's
  "<i>praestantissima recensio</i>," and founds his own text upon it two
  years after Madvig's crushing exposure in his <i>Em.</i> often quoted by
  me&mdash;not only reads <i>revocari</i>, but quotes <i>renovari</i> as an
  em. of the ed. Victoriana of 1536. From Orelli, Klotz, whose text has no
  independent value, took it. <i>Renovare</i> in Cic. often means "to
  refresh the memory," e.g. <a href="#BkI_11">11</a>, <i>Brut.</i> 315.
  <i>Nisi molestum est</i>: like <i>nisi alienum putas</i>, a variation on
  the common <i>si placet, si videtur</i>. <i>Adsidamus</i>: some MSS. have
  <i>adsideamus</i>, which would be wrong here. <i>Sane istud</i>: Halm
  <i>istuc</i> from G. <i>Inquit</i>: for the late position of this word,
  which is often caused by its affinity for <i>quoniam</i>, <i>quidem</i>,
  etc., cf. <i>M.D.F.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 20 <i>Quae cum
  essent dicta, in conspectu consedimus (omnes)</i>: most edd. since
  Gulielmus print this without <i>essent</i> as a hexameter, and suppose it
  a quotation. But firstly, a verse so commonplace, if familiar, would
  occur elsewhere in Cic. as others do, if not familiar, would not be given
  without the name of its author. Secondly, most MSS. have <i>sint</i> or
  <i>essent</i> before <i>dicta</i>. It is more probable therefore that
  <i>omnes</i> was added from an involuntary desire to make up the
  hexameter rhythm. Phrases like <i>quae cum essent dicta consedimus</i>
  often occur in similar places in Cic.'s dialogues cf. <i>De Div.</i>
  <span class="vol">II.</span> 150, and Augustine, the imitator of Cic.,
  <i>Contra Academicos</i>, <span class="vol">I.</span> 25, also
  <i>consedimus</i> at the end of a clause in <i>Brut.</i> 24, and
  <i>considitur</i> in <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 18.

  First part of Varro's Exposition, <a href="#BkI_15">15</a>&mdash;<a
  href="#BkI_18">18</a>. Summary. Socrates rejected physics and made ethics
  supreme in philosophy (<a href="#BkI_15">15</a>). He had no fixed tenets,
  his one doctrine being that wisdom consists in a consciousness of
  ignorance. Moral exhortation was his task (<a href="#BkI_16">16</a>).
  Plato added to and enriched the teaching of his master, from him sprang
  two schools which abandoned the negative position of Socrates and adopted
  definite tenets, yet remained in essential agreement with one
  another&mdash;the Peripatetic and the Academic (<a href="#BkI_17">17</a>,
  <a href="#BkI_18">18</a>).</blockquote>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_15"></a><a href="#BkI_15">§15</a>.</b> <i>A rebus ...
  involutis</i>: physical phenomena are often spoken of in these words by
  Cic., cf. <a href="#BkI_19">19</a>, <i>Timaeus</i> c. 1, <i>D.F.</i>
  <span class="vol">I.</span> 64, <span class="vol">IV.</span> 18, <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 10, <i>N.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 49.
  Ursinus rejected <i>ab</i> here, but the insertion or omission of
  <i>ab</i> after the passive verb depends on the degree to which
  <i>natura</i> is personified, if <a href="#BkI_28">28</a> be compared
  with <i>Tim.</i> c. 1, this will be clear. <i>Involutis</i> = veiled; cf.
  <i>involucrum</i>. Cic. shows his feeling of the metaphor by adding
  <i>quasi</i> in <span class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_26">26</a>,
  and often. <i>Avocavisse philosophiam</i>: this, the Xenophontic view of
  Socrates, was the popular one in Cicero's time, cf. <span
  class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_123">123</a>, <i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 10, <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span> 87, 88,
  also Varro in Aug. <i>De Civ. Dei</i>, <span class="vol">VIII.</span> 3.
  Objections to it, however occurred to Cic., and were curiously answered
  in <i>De Rep.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 16 (cf. also Varro in Aug.
  <i>De Civ. Dei</i>, <span class="vol">VIII.</span> 4). The same view is
  supposed to be found in Aristotle, see the passages quoted by R. and P.
  141. To form an opinion on this difficult question the student should
  read Schleiermacher's <i>Essay on the Worth of Socrates as a
  Philosopher</i> (trans. by Thirlwall), and Zeller's <i>Socrates and the
  Socratic Schools</i>, Eng. Trans., pp. 112&mdash;116 [I dissent from his
  view of Aristotle's evidence], also Schwegler's <i>Handbook</i>, so far
  as it relates to Socrates and Plato. <i>Nihil tamen ad bene vivendum
  valere</i>: <i>valere</i> is absent from MSS., and is inserted by Halm,
  its use in <a href="#BkI_21">21</a> makes it more probable than
  <i>conferre</i>, which is in ed. Rom. (1471). Gronovius vainly tries to
  justify the MSS. reading by such passages as <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 39, <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 70. The
  strangest ellipse with <i>nihil ad</i> elsewhere in Cic. is in <i>De
  Leg.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 6.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_16"></a><a href="#BkI_16">§16</a>.</b> <i>Hic ...
  illum</i>: for this repetition of pronouns see <i>M.D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">IV.</span> 43. <i>Varie et copiose</i>: MSS. omit <i>et</i>,
  but it may be doubted whether Cic. would let two <i>adverbs</i> stand
  together without <i>et</i>, though three may (cf. <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 63), and though with pairs of <i>nouns</i> and
  <i>adjectives, et</i> often is left out, as in the passages quoted here
  by Manut. <i>Ad Att.</i> <span class="vol">IV.</span> 3, 3, <i>Ad
  Fam.</i> <span class="vol">XIII.</span> 24, <span
  class="vol">XIII.</span> 28, cf. also the learned note of Wesenberg,
  reprinted in Baiter and Halm's edition, of Cic.'s philosophical works
  (1861), on <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 6. <i>Varie et
  copiose</i> is also in <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 240.
  Cf. the omission of <i>que</i> in <a href="#BkI_23">23</a>, also <span
  class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_63">63</a>. <i>Perscripti</i>: Cic.
  like Aristotle often speaks of Plato's dialogues as though they were
  authentic reports of Socratic conversations, cf. <span
  class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_74">74</a>. <i>Nihil adfirmet</i>:
  so <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 99. "<i>Eoque praestare
  ceteris</i>" this is evidently from Plato <i>Apol.</i> p. 21, as to the
  proper understanding of which see note on <span class="vol">II.</span> <a
  href="#BkIIN_74">74</a>. <i>Ab Apolline</i>, Plato <i>Apol.</i> 21 A,
  <i>Omnium</i>: Dav. conj. <i>hominum</i> needlessly. <i>Dictum</i>:
  Lamb., followed by Schutz, reads <i>iudicatum</i>, it is remarkable that
  in four passages where Cic. speaks of this very oracle (<i>Cato Mai.</i>
  78, <i>Lael.</i> 7, 9, 13) he uses the verb <i>iudicare</i>. <i>Una
  omnis</i>: Lamb. <i>hominis</i>, Baiter also. <i>Omnis eius oratio
  tamen</i>: <i>notwithstanding</i> his negative dialectic he gave positive
  teaching in morals. <i>Tamen</i>: for MSS. <i>tam</i> or <i>tum</i> is
  due to Gruter, Halm has <i>tantum</i>. <i>Tam</i>, <i>tum</i> and
  <i>tamen</i> are often confused in MSS., e.g. <i>In Veri</i> (<i>Act</i>
  <span class="vol">II.</span>) <span class="vol">I.</span> 3, 65, <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 55, 112, <span class="vol">V.</span> 78, where see
  Zumpt. Goer. abuses edd. for not knowing that <i>tum ... et</i>, <i>tum
  ... que</i>, <i>et ... tum</i>, correspond in Cic. like <i>tum ...
  cum</i>, <i>tum ... tum</i>. His proofs of this new Latin may be sampled
  by <i>Ac.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_1">1</a>, <a
  href="#BkII_43">43</a>. <i>Ad virtutis studium cohortandis</i>: this
  broad assertion is distinctly untrue; see Zeller's <i>Socrates</i> 88,
  with footnote.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_17"></a><a href="#BkI_17">§17</a>.</b> <i>Varius et
  multiplex, et copiosus</i>: these characteristics are named to account
  for the branching off from Plato of the later schools. For
  <i>multiplex</i> "many sided," cf. <i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 11. <i>Una et consentiens</i>: this is an opinion
  of Antiochus often adopted by Cic. in his own person, as in <i>D.F.</i>
  <span class="vol">IV.</span> 5 <i>De Leg.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span>
  38, <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 67. Five ancient
  philosophers are generally included in this supposed harmonious
  Academico-Peripatetic school, viz. Aristotle, Theophrastus, Speusippus,
  Xenocrates, Polemo (cf. <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">IV.</span> 2),
  sometimes Crantor is added. The harmony was supposed to have been first
  broken by Polemo's pupils; so Varro says (from Antiochus) in Aug. <i>De
  Civ. Dei</i> <span class="vol">XIX.</span> 1, cf. also <a
  href="#BkI_34">34</a>. Antiochus doubtless rested his theory almost
  entirely on the ethical resemblances of the two schools. In <i>D.F.</i>
  <span class="vol">V.</span> 21, which is taken direct from Antiochus,
  this appears, as also in Varro (in Aug. as above) who often spoke as
  though ethics were the whole of philosophy (cf. also <i>De Off.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 20). Antiochus probably made light of such
  dialectical controversies between the two schools as that about <span
  lang="el" title="ideai" >&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>,
  which had long ceased. Krische <i>Uber Cicero's Akademika</i> p. 51, has
  some good remarks. <i>Nominibus</i>: the same as <i>vocabulis</i> above.
  Cic. does not observe Varro's distinction (<i>De L. L.</i> <span
  class="vol">IX.</span> 1) which confines <i>nomen</i> to proper nouns,
  <i>vocabulum</i> to common nouns, though he would not use
  <i>vocabulum</i> as Tac. does, for the name of a person (<i>Annals</i>
  <span class="vol">XII.</span> 66, etc.). <i>Quasi heredem ... duos
  autem</i>: the conj. of Ciaconus "<i>ex asse heredem, secundos autem</i>"
  is as acute as it is absurd. <i>Duos</i>: it is difficult to decide
  whether this or <i>duo</i> is right in Cic., he can scarcely have been so
  inconsistent as the MSS. and edd. make him (cf. Baiter and Halm's ed.,
  <i>Ac.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_11">11</a>, <a
  href="#BkII_13">13</a> with <i>De Div.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span>
  6). The older inscr. in the <i>Corpus</i> vol. <span
  class="vol">I.</span> have <i>duo</i>, but only in <i>duoviros</i>, two
  near the time of Cic. (<i>C.I.</i> vol. <span class="vol">I.</span> nos.
  571 and 1007) give <i>duos</i>, which Cic. probably wrote. <i>Duo</i> is
  in old Latin poets and Virgil. <i>Chalcedonium</i>: not
  <i>Calchedonium</i> as Klotz, cf. Gk. <span lang="el"
  title="Chalkêdonion"
  >&#x3A7;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;&#x3B4;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>.
  <i>Praestantissimos</i>: Halm wrongly, cf. <i>Brut.</i> 125.
  <i>Stagiritem</i>: not <i>Stagiritam</i> as Lamb., for Cic., exc. in a
  few nouns like <i>Persa</i>, <i>pirata</i>, etc., which came down from
  antiquity, did not make Greek nouns in <span lang="el" title="-ês"
  >-&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span> into Latin nouns in <i>-a</i>. See <i>M.D.F.</i>
  <span class="vol">II.</span> 94. <i>Coetus ... soliti</i>: cf. <a
  href="#BkI_10">10</a>. <i>Platonis ubertate</i>: cf. Quintilian's
  "<i>illa Livii lactea ubertas</i>." <i>Plenum ac refertam</i>: n. on <a
  href="#BkIN_11">11</a>. <i>Dubitationem</i>: Halm with one MS., G, gives
  <i>dubitantem</i>, Baiter <i>dubitanter</i>, Why alter? <i>Ars quaedam
  philosophiae</i>: before these words all Halm's MSS., exc G, insert
  <i>disserendi</i>, probably from the line above, Lipsius keeps it and
  ejects <i>philosophiae</i>, while Lamb., Day read <i>philosophia</i> in
  the nom. Varro, however, would never say that philosophy became entirely
  dialectical in the hands of the old Academics and Peripatetics.
  <i>Ars</i> = <span lang="el" title="technê"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3C7;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>, a set of definite rules, so
  Varro in Aug. (as above) speaks of the <i>certa dogmata</i> of this old
  school as opposed to the incertitude of the New Academy.
  <i>Descriptio</i>: so Halm here, but often <i>discriptio</i>. The
  <i>Corp. Inscr.</i>, vol. <span class="vol">I.</span> nos. 198 and 200,
  has thrice <i>discriptos</i> or <i>discriptum</i>, the other spelling
  never.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_18"></a><a href="#BkI_18">§18</a>.</b> <i>Ut mihi
  quidem videtur</i>: MSS. transpose <i>quidem</i> and <i>videtur</i>, as
  in <a href="#BkI_44">44</a>. <i>Quidem</i>, however nearly always comes
  closely after the pronoun, see <i>M.D.F.</i> <span class="vol">IV.</span>
  43, cf. also <span class="vol">I.</span> 71, <span

  more in n. on <a href="#BkIN_36">36</a>. The Platonic and Aristotelian
  ethics have indeed an external resemblance, but the ultimate bases of the
  two are quite different. In rejecting the Idea of the Good, Aristotle did
  away with what Plato would have considered most valuable in his system.
  The ideal theory, however, was practically defunct in the time of
  Antiochus, so that the similarity between the two schools seemed much
  greater than it was. <i>Non sus Minervam</i>: a Greek proverb, cf.
  Theocr. <i>Id.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span> 23, <i>De Or.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 233, <i>Ad Fam.</i> <span class="vol">IX.</span>
  18, 3. Binder, in his German translation of the <i>Academica</i>, also
  quotes Plutarch <i>Præc. Polit.</i> 7. <i>Inepte ... docet</i>: elliptic
  for <i>inepte docet, quisquis docet</i>. <i>Nostra atque nostros</i>: few
  of the editors have understood this. Atticus affects everything Athenian,
  and speaks as though he were one of them; in Cic.'s letters to him the
  words "<i>tui cives</i>," meaning the Athenians, often occur. <i>Quid me
  putas</i>: i.e. <i>velle</i>. <i>Exhibiturum</i>: Halm inserts <i>me</i>
  before this from his one MS. G, evidently emended here by its copyist.
  For the omission of <i>me</i>, cf. note on <a href="#BkIN_7">7</a>.</p>

  href="#BkI_23">23</a>.</b> Part <span class="vol">II.</span> of Varro's
  Exposition: Antiochus' <i>Ethics</i>. Summary. The threefold division of
  philosophy into <span lang="el" title="êthikê, physikê, dialektikê"

  Goodness means obedience to nature, happiness the acquisition of natural
  advantages. These are of three kinds, mental, bodily, and external. The
  bodily are described (<a href="#BkI_19">19</a>); then the mental, which
  fall into two classes, congenital and acquired, virtue being the chief of
  the acquired (<a href="#BkI_20">20</a>), then the external, which form
  with the bodily advantages a kind of exercise-ground for virtue (<a
  href="#BkI_21">21</a>). The ethical standard is then succinctly stated,
  in which virtue has chief part, and is capable in itself of producing
  happiness, though not the greatest happiness possible, which requires the
  possession of all three classes of advantages (<a href="#BkI_22">22</a>).
  With this ethical standard, it is possible to give an intelligent account
  of action and duty (<a href="#BkI_23">23</a>).</blockquote>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_19"></a><a href="#BkI_19">§19</a>.</b> <i>Ratio
  triplex</i>: Plato has not this division, either consciously or
  unconsciously, though it was generally attributed to him in Cicero's
  time, so by Varro himself (from Antiochus) in Aug. <i>De Civ. Dei</i>
  <span class="vol">VIII.</span> 4, and by Diog. Laert. <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 56 (see R. and P., p. 195). The division itself
  cannot be traced farther back than Xenocrates and the post-Aristotelian
  Peripatetics, to whom it is assigned by Sext. Emp. <i>Adv. Math.</i>
  <span class="vol">VII.</span> 16. It was probably first brought into
  strong prominence by the Stoics, whom it enabled more sharply and
  decisively to subordinate to Ethics all else in philosophy. Cf. esp.
  <i>M.D.F.</i> <span class="vol">IV.</span> 3. <i>Quid verum ... repugnans
  iudicando</i>: MSS. exc. G have <i>et</i> before <i>quid falsum</i>,
  whence Klotz conj. <i>sit</i> in order to obviate the awkwardness of
  <i>repugnet</i> which MSS. have for <i>repugnans</i>. Krische wishes to
  read <i>consequens</i> for <i>consentiens</i>, comparing <i>Orator</i>
  115, <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span> 68, <i>De Div.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 150, to which add <i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 21 On the other hand cf. <span
  class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_22">22</a>, <a
  href="#BkII_91">91</a>. Notice the double translations of the Greek
  terms, <i>de vita et moribus</i> for <span lang="el" title="êthikê"
  >&#x3B7;&#x3B8;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;</span>, etc. This is very
  characteristic of Cic., as we shall see later. <i>Ac primum</i>: many
  MSS. and edd. <i>primam</i>, cf. <a href="#BkI_23">23</a>, <a
  href="#BkI_30">30</a>. <i>A natura petebant</i>: how Antiochus could have
  found this in Plato and Aristotle is difficult to see; that he did so,
  however, is indubitable; see <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span>
  24&mdash;27, which should be closely compared with our passage, and Varro
  in Aug. <span class="vol">XIX.</span> 3. The root of Plato's system is
  the <span lang="el" title="idea" >&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;</span> of
  the Good, while so far is Aristotle from founding his system on the
  abstract <span lang="el" title="physis"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>, that he scarcely appeals
  even incidentally to <span lang="el" title="physis"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span> in his ethical works. The
  abstract conception of nature in relation to ethics is first strongly
  apparent in Polemo, from whom it passed into Stoic hands and then into
  those of Antiochus. <i>Adeptum esse omnia</i>: put rather differently in
  <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span> 24, 26, cf. also <i>D.F.</i>
  <span class="vol">II.</span> 33, 34, <i>Ac.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_131">131</a>. <i>Et animo et
  corpore et vita</i>: this is the <span lang="el" title="trias"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span> or <span lang="el"

  &#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD; &#x3B1;&#x3B3;&#x3B1;&#x3B8;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>,
  which belongs in this form to late Peripateticism (cf. <i>M.D.F.</i>
  <span class="vol">III.</span> 43), the third division is a development
  from the <span lang="el" title="bios teleios"
  >&#x3B2;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;
  &#x3C4;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> of Aristotle.
  The <span lang="el" title="trias"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C2;</span> in this distinct shape is
  foreign both to Plato and Arist, though Stobaeus, <i>Ethica</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 6, 4, tries hard to point it out in Plato; Varro
  seems to merge the two last divisions into one in Aug. <i>De Civ. Dei</i>
  XIX 3. This agrees better with <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span>
  34&mdash;36, cf. also Aug. <span class="vol">VIII.</span> 8. On the
  Antiochean <i>finis</i> see more in note on <a href="#BkIN_22">22</a>.

  is in Stob. <i>Eth.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 6, 7; cf. also
  <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span> 35. <i>Pulchritudinem</i>: Cic.
  <i>Orator</i> 160, puts the spelling <i>pulcher</i> beyond a doubt; it
  often appears in inscr. of the Republic. On the other hand only
  <i>pulcrai</i>, <i>pulcrum</i>, etc., occur in inscr., exc.
  <i>pulchre</i>, which is found once (<i>Corp. Inscr.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> no 1019). <i>Sepulchrum</i>, however, is frequent
  at an early time. On the tendency to aspirate even native Latin words see
  Boscher in Curtius' <i>Studien</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 1, p.
  145. In the case of <i>pulcher</i> the false derivation from <span

  &#x3C6;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;</span> is one of Goerenz's numerous
  forgeries. The ablative is always conditioned by some verb, see Madv. A
  comparison of this statement of the ethical <i>finis</i> with that in <a
  href="#BkI_19">19</a> and the passages quoted in my note there, will show
  that Cic. drew little distinction between the Stoic <span lang="el"
  title="ta prôta kata physin" >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;

  this is historically absurd Madvig shows in his <i>Excursus</i>, but he
  does not sufficiently recognise the fact that Cicero has perfectly
  correctly reported Antiochus. At all events, Varro's report (Aug. <i>De
  Civ. Dei</i> <span class="vol">XIX.</span> 3) coincides with Cic.'s in
  every particular. Even the <i>inexplicabilis perversitas</i> of which
  Madv. complains (p. 821) is traceable to Antiochus, who, as will be seen
  from Augustine <span class="vol">XIX.</span> 1, 3, included even
  <i>virtus</i> among the <i>prima naturae</i>. A little reflection will
  show that in no other way could Antiochus have maintained the practical
  identity of the Stoic and Peripatetic views of the <i>finis</i>. I regret
  that my space does not allow me to pursue this difficult subject farther.

  <i>Physics</i>. Summary. All that is consists of force and matter, which
  are never actually found apart, though they are thought of as separate.
  When force impresses form on the formless matter, it becomes a formed
  entity (<span lang="el" title="poion ti"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD; &#x3C4;&#x3B9;</span> or
  <i>quale</i>)&mdash;(<a href="#BkI_24">24</a>). These formed entities are
  either <i>primary</i> or <i>secondary</i>. Air, fire, water, earth are
  primary, the two first having an active, the two last a passive function.
  Aristotle added a fifth (<a href="#BkI_26">26</a>). Underlying all formed
  entities is the formless matter, matter and space are infinitely
  subdivisible (<a href="#BkI_27">27</a>). Force or form acts on the
  formless matter and so produces the ordered universe, outside which no
  matter exists. Reason permeates the universe and makes it eternal. This
  Reason has various names&mdash;Soul of the Universe, Mind, Wisdom,
  Providence, Fate, Fortune are only different titles for the same thing
  (<a href="#BkI_28">28</a>, <a href="#BkI_29">29</a>).</blockquote>

  Aristotle's doctrine is to be got from Schwegler, <i>Handbook</i>, pp

  <i>fungi</i>. <i>Ea quae</i>: so Gruter, Halm for MSS. <i>eaque.</i> The
  meaning is this; passive matter when worked upon by an active generative
  form results in an <i>aliquid</i>, a <span lang="el" title="tode ti"
  >&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3B4;&#x3B5; &#x3C4;&#x3B9;</span> as Aristotle calls

  passing into actual <span lang="el" title="tode ti"

  also Arist. <i>Metaph</i> H, 1, R. and P. 270&mdash;274). A figurative
  description of the process is given in <i>Timaeus</i>, 50 D. <i>In eo
  quod efficeret ... materiam quandam</i>: Cic. is hampered by the
  <i>patrii sermonis egestas</i>, which compels him to render simple Greek
  terms by laboured periphrases. <i>Id quod efficit</i> is not distinct
  from, but <i>equivalent</i> to <i>vis</i>, <i>id quod efficitur</i> to
  <i>materia</i>. <i>Materiam quandam</i>: it is extraordinary how edd.
  (esp Goer.) could have so stumbled over <i>quandam</i> and <i>quasi</i>
  used in this fashion. Both words (which are joined below) simply mark the
  unfamiliarity of the Latin word in its philosophical use, in the Greek
  <span lang="el" title="hylê" >&#x201B;&#x3C5;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;</span> the
  strangeness had had time to wear off. <i>In utroque</i>: for <i>in eo
  quod ex utroque</i> (sc. <i>vi et materia</i>) <i>fit</i>, the meaning is
  clearly given by the next clause, viz. that Force and Matter cannot
  actually exist apart, but only in the compound of the two, the formed
  entity, which doctrine is quite Aristotelian. See the reff. given above.
  <i>Nihil enim est quod non alicubi esse cogatur</i>: the meaning of this
  is clear, that nothing can <i>exist</i> except in space <i>(alicubi)</i>,
  it is more difficult to see why it should be introduced here. Unless
  <i>est</i> be taken of merely phenomenal existence (the only existence
  the Stoics and Antiochus would allow), the sentence does not represent
  the belief of Aristotle and Plato. The <span lang="el" title="ideai"
  >&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span> for instance, though to Plato
  in the highest sense existent, do not exist in space. (Aristotle
  explicitly says this, <i>Phys.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 4).
  Aristotle also recognised much as existent which did not exist in space,
  as in <i>Phys.</i> <span class="vol">IV.</span> 5 (qu. R. and P. 289).
  Cic. perhaps translates here from <i>Tim.</i> 52 B, <span lang="el"

  for the primary Matter and Force. <i>Aër et ignis</i>: this is Stoic but
  <i>not</i> Aristotelian. Aristot., starting with the four necessary
  properties of matter, viz. heat, cold, dryness, moisture, marks the two
  former as active, the two latter as passive. He then assigns <i>two</i>
  of these properties, <i>one</i> active and <i>one</i> passive, to each of
  the four elements; each therefore is to him <i>both</i> active and
  passive. The Stoics assign only <i>one</i> property to each element; heat
  to fire, cold to air (cf. <i>N.D.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 26),
  moisture to water, dryness to earth. The doctrine of the text follows at
  once. Cf. Zeller, pp. 155, 187 sq., with footnotes, R. and P. 297 sq.

  <i>Non in nihilum</i>: this is aimed at the Atomists, who maintained that
  infinite subdivision logically led to the passing of things into nothing
  and their reparation out of nothing again. See Lucr. <span

  infinite subdivisibility of matter had become so thoroughly the orthodox
  one that the Atom was scouted as a silly absurdity. Cf. <i>D.F.</i> <span

  followed Aristotle very closely (R. and P. 377, 378). <i>Intervallis
  moveri</i>: this is the theory of motion without void which Lucr. <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 370 sq. disproves, where see Munro. Cf. also Sext.
  Emp. <i>Adv. Math.</i> <span class="vol">VII.</span> 214. Aristotle
  denied the existence of void either within or without the universe,
  Strato allowed its possibility within, while denying its existence
  without (Stob. <span class="vol">I.</span> 18, 1), the Stoics did the
  exact opposite affirming its existence without, and denying it within the
  universe (Zeller 186, with footnotes). <i>Quae intervalla ...
  possint</i>: there is no ultimate space atom, just as there is no matter
  atom. As regards space, the Stoics and Antiochus closely followed
  Aristotle, whose ideas may be gathered from R. and P. 288, 9, and
  especially from M. Saint Hilaire's explanation of the <i>Physica</i>.</p>

  is thorough going Stoicism. Reason, God, Matter, Universe, are
  interchangeable terms with the Stoics. See Zeller 145&mdash;150 By an

  Universe, they sometimes speak of it as being <i>in</i> the Universe, as
  here (cf. Diog. Laert. <span class="vol">VII.</span> 138, <i>N.D.</i>

  inconsistency. For the Pantheistic idea cf. Pope "lives through all life,
  extends through all extent". <i>Sempiterna</i>: Aristotle held this: see

  (Diog. Laert. <span class="vol">VII.</span> 141, R. and P. 378, Stob.

  of himself, since he is beyond the reach of harm (Diog. Laert. <span

  href="#BkI_32">32</a>.</b> Part iv. of Varro's Exposition: Antiochus'
  <i>Ethics</i>. Summary. Although the old Academics and Peripatetics based
  knowledge on the senses, they did not make the senses the criterion of
  truth, but the mind, because it alone saw the permanently real and true
  (<a href="#BkI_30">30</a>). The senses they thought heavy and clogged and
  unable to gain knowledge of such things as were either too small to come
  into the domain of sense, or so changing and fleeting that no part of
  their being remained constant or even the same, seeing that all parts
  were in a continuous flux. Knowledge based <i>only</i> on sense was
  therefore mere opinion (<a href="#BkI_31">31</a>). Real knowledge only
  came through the reasonings of the mind, hence they <i>defined</i>
  everything about which they argued, and also used verbal explanations,
  from which they drew proofs. In these two processes consisted their
  dialectic, to which they added persuasive rhetoric (<a

  an almost perfect iambic, strongly stopped off before and after, so that
  there is no possibility of avoiding it in reading. I venture to say that
  no real parallel can be found to this in Cic., it stands in glaring

  difficulty here. The words <i>iam a Platone ita nom</i> seem to exclude
  Plato from the supposed old Academico-Peripatetic school. This may be an
  oversight, but to say first that the school (<i>illi</i>, cf. <i>sic
  tractabatur ab utrisque</i>) which included Aristotle held the doctrine
  of <span lang="el" title="ideai"
  >&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>, and next, in <a
  href="#BkI_33">33</a>, that Aristotle crushed the same doctrine, appears
  very absurd. We may reflect, however, that the difference between Plato's
  <span lang="el" title="ideai" >&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>
  and Aristotle's <span lang="el" title="ta kathalou" >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;
  &#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3C5;</span> would naturally
  seem microscopic to Antiochus. Both theories were practically as dead in
  his time as those of Thales or Anaxagoras. The confusion must not be laid
  at Cicero's door, for Antiochus in reconciling his own dialectics with
  Plato's must have been driven to desperate shifts. Cicero's very
  knowledge of Plato has, however, probably led him to intensify what
  inconsistency there was in Antiochus, who would have glided over Plato's
  opinions with a much more cautious step.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_31"></a><a href="#BkI_31">§31</a>.</b> <i>Sensus

  href="#BkII_19">19</a> <i>sensibus quorum ita clara et certa iudicia
  sunt</i>, etc.: Antiochus would probably defend his agreement with Plato
  by asserting that though sense is naturally dull, reason may sift out the
  certain from the uncertain. <i>Res eas ... quae essent aut ita</i>: Halm
  by following his pet MS. without regard to the meaning of Cic. has
  greatly increased the difficulty of the passage. He reads <i>res ullas
  ... quod aut ita essent</i>; thus making Antiochus assert that <i>no</i>
  true information can be got from sensation, whereas, as we shall see in
  the <i>Lucullus</i>, he really divided sensations into true and false. I
  believe that we have a mixture here of Antiochus' real view with Cicero's
  reminiscences of the <i>Theaetetus</i> and of Xenocrates; see below.
  <i>Nec percipere</i>: for this see <i>Lucullus</i> passim. Christ's conj.
  <i>percipi, quod perceptio sit mentis non sensuum</i>, which Halm seems

  <i>eidem</i>. In the <i>Theaetetus</i>, Heraclitus' theory of flux is
  carried to such an extent as to destroy the self-identity of things; even
  the word <span lang="el" title="eme" >&#x3B5;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;</span> is

  <i>Definitiones rerum</i>: these must be carefully distinguished fiom
  <i>definitiones nominum</i>, see the distinction drawn after Aristotle in
  R. and P. 265, note b. The <i>definitio rei</i> really involves the whole
  of philosophy with Plato and Aristotle (one might almost add, with
  moderns too). Its importance to Plato may be seen from the
  <i>Politicus</i> and <i>Sophistes</i>, to Aristotle from the passages
  quoted in R. and P. pp. 265, 271, whose notes will make the subject as
  clear as it can be made to any one who has not a knowledge of the whole
  of Aristotle's philosophy. <i>Verborum explicatio</i>: this is quite a
  different thing from those <i>definitiones nominum</i> just referred to;
  it is <i>derivation</i>, which does not necessitate definition. <span
  lang="el" title="etymologian"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</span>:
  this is almost entirely Stoic. The word is foreign to the Classic Greek
  Prose, as are <span lang="el" title="etymos"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span> and all its
  derivatives. (<span lang="el" title="Etymôs"
  >&#x395;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3C9;&#x3C2;</span> means "etymologically"
  in the <i>De Mundo</i>, which however is not Aristotle's). The word <span
  lang="el" title="etymologia"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>
  is itself not frequent in the older Stoics, who use rather <span
  lang="el" title="onomatôn orthotês"
  >&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B8;&#x3BF;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C2;</span> (Diog. Laert.
  <span class="vol">VII.</span> 83), the title of their books on the
  subject preserved by Diog. is generally "<span lang="el" title="peri tôn etymologikôn"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B9; &#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span>"
  The systematic pursuit of etymology was not earlier than Chrysippus, when
  it became distinctive of the Stoic school, though Zeno and Cleanthes had
  given the first impulse (<i>N.D.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 63).
  Specimens of Stoic etymology are given in <i>N.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> and ridiculed in <i>N.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> (cf. esp. 62 <i>in enodandis nominibus quod
  miserandum sit laboratis</i>). <i>Post argumentis et quasi rerum notis
  ducibus</i>: the use of etymology in rhetoric in order to prove something
  about the thing denoted by the word is well illustrated in <i>Topica</i>
  10, 35. In this rhetorical sense Cic. rejects the translation
  <i>veriloquium</i> of <span lang="el" title="etymologia"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>
  and adopts <i>notatio</i>, the <i>rerum nota</i> (Greek <span lang="el"
  title="symbolon"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>) being
  the name so explained (<i>Top.</i> 35). Varro translated <span lang="el"
  title="etymologia"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C4;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>
  by <i>originatio</i> (Quintil. <span class="vol">I.</span> 6, 28).
  Aristotle had already laid down rules for this rhetorical use of
  etymology, and Plato also incidentally adopts it, so it may speciously be
  said to belong to the old Academico-Peripatetic school. A closer
  examination of authorities would have led Halm to retract his bad em.
  <i>notationibus</i> for <i>notas ducibus</i>, the word <i>notatio</i> is
  used for the whole science of etymology, and not for particular
  derivations, while Cic. in numerous passages (e.g. <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 74) describes <i>verba</i> or <i>nomina</i> as
  <i>rerum notae</i>. Berkley's <i>nodis</i> for <i>notis</i> has no
  support, (<i>enodatio nominum</i> in <i>N.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 62 is quite different). One more remark, and I
  conclude this wearisome note. The <i>quasi</i> marks <i>rerum nota</i> as
  an unfamiliar trans. of <span lang="el" title="symbolon"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B2;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>. Davies
  therefore ought not to have placed it before <i>ducibus</i>, which word,
  strong as the metaphor is, requires no qualification, see a good instance
  in <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 27. <i>Itaque tradebatur</i>:
  so Halm improves on Madvig's <i>ita</i> for <i>in qua</i> of the MSS.,
  which cannot be defended. Orelli's reference to <a href="#BkI_30">30</a>
  <i>pars</i> for an antecedent to <i>qua</i> (<i>in ea parte in qua</i>)
  is violent, while Goerenz's resort to <i>partem rerum opinabilem</i> is
  simply silly. Manut. conj. <i>in quo</i>, Cic. does often use the neut.
  pronoun, as in <i>Orator</i> 3, but not quite thus. I have sometimes
  thought that Cic. wrote <i>haec, inquam</i> (cf. <i>huic</i> below).
  <i>Dialecticae</i>: as <span lang="el" title="logikê"
  >&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;</span> had not been
  Latinised, Cic. is obliged to use this word to denote <span lang="el"
  title="logikê" >&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;</span>, of
  which <span lang="el" title="dialektikê"

  which is mentioned in the next sentence being the other; see Zeller 69,
  70. <i>Orationis ratione conclusae</i>: speech drawn up in a syllogistic

  <span lang="el" title="ideai" >&#x3B9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;</span>
  of Plato, Theophrastus weakened the power of virtue (<a
  href="#BkI_33">33</a>). Strato abandoned ethics for physics, Speusippus,
  Xenocrates, Polemo, Crates, Crantor faithfully kept the old tradition, to
  which Zeno and Arcesilas, pupils of Polemo, were both disloyal (<a
  href="#BkI_34">34</a>). Zeno maintained that nothing but virtue could
  influence happiness, and would allow the name <i>good</i> to nothing else
  (<a href="#BkI_35">35</a>). All other things he divided into three
  classes, some were in accordance with nature, some at discord with
  nature, and some were neutral. To the first class he assigned a positive
  value, and called them <i>preferred</i> to the second a negative value
  and called them <i>rejected</i>, to the third no value
  whatever&mdash;mere verbal alterations on the old scheme (<a
  href="#BkI_36">36</a>, <a href="#BkI_37">37</a>). Though the terms
  <i>right action</i> and <i>sin</i> belong only to virtue and vice, he
  thought there was an appropriate action (<i>officium</i>) and an
  inappropriate, which concerned things <i>preferred</i> and things
  <i>rejected</i> (<a href="#BkI_37">37</a>). He made <i>all</i> virtue
  reside in the reason, and considered not the <i>practice</i> but the mere
  <i>possession</i> of virtue to be the important thing, although the
  possession could not but lead to the practice (<a href="#BkI_38">38</a>).
  All emotion he regarded as unnatural and immoral (<a
  href="#BkI_38">38</a>, <a href="#BkI_39">39</a>). In physics he discarded
  the fifth element, and believed fire to be the universal substance, while
  he would not allow the existence of anything incorporeal (<a
  href="#BkI_39">39</a>). In dialectic he analysed sensation into two
  parts, an impulse from without, and a succeeding judgment of the mind, in
  passing which the will was entirely free (<a href="#BkI_40">40</a>).
  Sensations (<i>visa</i>) he divided into the true and the untrue; if the
  examination gone through by the mind proved irrefragably the truth of a
  sensation he called it <i>Knowledge</i>, if otherwise, <i>Ignorance</i>
  (<a href="#BkI_41">41</a>). <i>Perception</i>, thus defined, he regarded
  as morally neither right nor wrong but as the sole ultimate basis of
  truth. Rashness in giving assent to phenomena, and all other defects in
  the application to them of the reason he thought could not coexist with
  virtue and perfect wisdom (<a href="#BkI_42">42</a>).</blockquote>

  <i>Immutationes</i>: so Dav. for <i>disputationes</i>, approved by Madv.

  Halm's odd em. <i>dissupationes</i>, so much admired by his reviewer in
  Schneidewin's <i>Philologus</i>, needs support, which it certainly does
  not receive from the one passage Halm quotes, <i>De Or.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 207. <i>Et recte</i>: for the <i>et</i> cf. <i>et
  merito</i>, which begins one of Propertius' elegies. <i>Auctoritas</i>:
  "system". <i>Inquit</i>: sc. Atticus of course. Goer., on account of the
  omission of <i>igitur</i> after Aristoteles, supposes Varro's speech to
  begin here. To the objection that Varro (who in <a href="#BkI_8">8</a>
  says <i>nihil enim meorum magno opere miror</i>) would not eulogise
  himself quite so unblushingly, Goer. feebly replies that the eulogy is
  meant for Antiochus, whom Varro is copying. <i>Aristoteles</i>: after
  this the copyist of Halm's G. alone, and evidently on his own conjecture,
  inserts <i>igitur</i>, which H. adopts. Varro's resumption of his
  exposition is certainly abrupt, but if chapter <span
  class="vol">IX.</span> ought to begin here, as Halm supposes, a reader
  would not be much incommoded. <i>Labefactavit</i>, that Antiochus still
  continued to include Aristotle in the supposed old Academico-Peripatetic
  school can only be explained by the fact that he considered ethical
  resemblances as of supreme importance, cf. the strong statement of Varro
  in Aug. <span class="vol">XIX.</span> 1 <i>nulla est causa philosophandi
  nisi finis boni</i>. <i>Divinum</i>: see R. and P. 210 for a full
  examination of the relation in which Plato's <span lang="el"

  notion of the deity. <i>Suavis</i>: his constant epithet, see Gellius qu.
  R. and P. 327. His real name was not Theophrastus, he was called so from
  his style (cf. <i>loquendi nitor ille divinus</i>, Quint. <span
  class="vol">X.</span> 1, 83). For <i>suavis</i> of style cf. <i>Orat.</i>
  161, <i>Brut.</i> 120. <i>Negavit</i>: for his various offences see
  <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span> 12 sq., <i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 25, 85. There is no reason to suppose that he
  departed very widely from the Aristotelian ethics; we have here a Stoic
  view of him transmitted through Antiochus. In <span
  class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_134">134</a> Cic. speaks very
  differently of him. Between the particular tenet here mentioned and that
  of Antiochus in <a href="#BkI_22">22</a> the difference is merely verbal.

  teachers (Diog. <span class="vol">VII.</span> 2, 3), while he is not
  mentioned by Diog. at all among the teachers of Arcesilas. The fact is
  that we have a mere theory, which accounts for the split of Stoicism from
  Academicism by the rivalry of two fellow pupils. Cf. Numenius in Euseb.

  the sixth Excursus to his <i>D.F.</i> <i>Solum et unum bonum</i>: for the

  presence or absence of which cannot affect happiness. The Stoics loudly
  protested against their being called either <i>bona</i> or <i>mala</i>,
  and this question was one of the great battle grounds of the later Greek
  philosophy. <i>Secundum naturam ... contraria</i>: Gr. <span lang="el"

  <p><b><a name="BkIN_37"></a><a href="#BkI_37">§37</a>.</b> To cope
  thoroughly with the extraordinary difficulties of this section the
  student must read the whole of the chapters on Stoic ethics in Zeller and
  Ritter and Preller. There is no royal road to the knowledge, which it
  would be absurd to attempt to convey in these notes. Assuming a general
  acquaintance with Stoic ethics, I set out the difficulties thus: Cic.
  appears at first sight to have made the <span lang="el"
  title="apoproêgmena"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B7;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>
  a subdivision of the <span lang="el" title="lêpta"
  >&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span> (<i>sumenda</i>), the two
  being utterly different. I admit, with Madv. (<i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 50), that there is no reason for suspecting the
  text to be corrupt, the heroic remedy of Dav., therefore, who reads
  <i>media</i> in the place of <i>sumenda</i>, must be rejected. Nor can
  anything be said for Goerenz's plan, who distorts the Stoic philosophy in
  order to save Cicero's consistency. On the other hand, I do not believe
  that Cic. could so utterly misunderstand one of the cardinal and best
  known doctrines of Stoicism, as to think even for a moment that the <span
  lang="el" title="apoproêgmena"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B7;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>
  formed a branch of the <span lang="el" title="lêpta"
  >&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>. This view of Madvig's is
  strongly opposed to the fact that Cic. in <a href="#BkI_36">36</a> had
  explained with perfect correctness the Stoic theory of the <span
  lang="el" title="adiaphora"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>, nor is
  there anywhere in the numerous passages where he touches on the theory
  any trace of the same error. My explanation is that Cic. began with the
  intention to speak of the <i>sumenda</i> only and then rapidly extended
  his thought so as to embrace the whole class of <span lang="el"
  title="adiaphora"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>, which
  he accordingly dealt with in the latter part of the same sentence and in
  the succeeding sentence. (The remainder has its own difficulties, which I
  defer for the present.) Cic. therefore is chargeable not with ignorance
  of Stoicism but with careless writing. A striking parallel occurs in
  <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 52, <i>quae secundum locum
  obtinent</i>, <span lang="el" title="proêgmena"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B7;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>
  <i>id est producta nominentur, quae vel ita appellemus, vel promota et
  remota</i>. If this language be closely pressed, the <span lang="el"
  title="apoproêgmena"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B7;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>
  are made of a subdivision of the <span lang="el" title="proêgmena"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B7;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>,
  though no sensible reader would suppose Cic. to have had that intention.
  So if his words in <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span> 90 be pressed,
  the <i>sumenda</i> are made to include both <i>producta</i> and
  <i>reducta</i>, in <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 16
  <i>appeterent</i> includes <i>fugerent</i>, <i>ibid.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 86 the opposite of <i>beata vita</i> is abruptly
  introduced. So <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 88 <i>frui
  dolore</i> must be construed together, and <i>ibid.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 73 <i>pudor modestia pudicitia</i> are said
  <i>coerceri</i>, the writer's thoughts having drifted on rapidly to the
  vices which are opposite to these virtues.</p>

  <p>I now pass on to a second class of difficulties. Supposing that by
  <i>ex iis</i> Cic. means <i>mediis</i>, and not <i>sumendis</i>, about
  which he had intended to talk when he began the sentence; I believe that
  <i>pluris aestimanda</i> and <i>minoris aestimanda</i> simply indicate
  the <span lang="el" title="axia" >&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> and
  <span lang="el" title="apaxia"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> of the Greek,
  <i>not</i> different degrees of <span lang="el" title="axia"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> (positive value). That <i>minor
  aestimatio</i> should mean <span lang="el" title="apaxia"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> need not surprise us
  when we reflect (1) on the excessive difficulty there was in expressing
  this <span lang="el" title="apaxia"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> or negative value in
  Latin, a difficulty I have already observed on <a href="#BkIN_36">36</a>;
  (2) on the strong negative meaning which <i>minor</i> bears in Latin,
  e.g. <i>sin minus</i> in Cic. means "but if not." Even the Greeks fall
  victims to the task of expressing <span lang="el" title="apaxia"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>. Stobaeus, in a
  passage closely resembling ours makes <span lang="el" title="elattôn axia"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3C4;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> equivalent to <span lang="el"
  title="pollê apaxia" >&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3BB;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;
  &#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> (II. 6, 6), while Sext.
  Emp. after rightly defining <span lang="el" title="apoproêgmena"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3C1;&#x3BF;&#x3B7;&#x3B3;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;</span>
  as <span lang="el" title="ta hikanên apaxian echonta" >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;
  &#x201B;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B5;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span> (<i>Adv. Math.</i>
  <span class="vol">XI.</span> 62&mdash;64) again speaks of them as <span
  lang="el" title="ta mê hikanên echonta axian" >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;
  &#x3BC;&#x3B7; &#x201B;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B5;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;
  &#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;</span> (<i>Pyrrhon. Hypot.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 191) words which usually have an opposite
  meaning. Now I contend that Cicero's words <i>minoris aestimanda</i> bear
  quite as strong a negative meaning as the phrase of Sextus, <span
  lang="el" title="ta mê hikanên axian echonta" >&#x3C4;&#x3B1;
  &#x3BC;&#x3B7; &#x201B;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;
  &#x3B5;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>. I therefore conclude
  that Cicero has striven, so far as the Latin language allowed, to express
  the Stoic doctrine that, of the <span lang="el" title="adiaphora"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3B4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3C6;&#x3BF;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;</span>, some
  have <span lang="el" title="axia" >&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>
  while others have <span lang="el" title="apaxia"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>. He may fairly claim
  to have applied to his words the rule "<i>re intellecta in verborum usu
  faciles esse debemus</i>" (<i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 52).
  There is quite as good ground for accusing Sextus and Stobaeus of
  misunderstanding the Stoics as there is for accusing Cicero. There are
  difficulties connected with the terms <span lang="el" title="hikanê axia"
  >&#x201B;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;
  &#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> and <span lang="el" title="hikanê apaxia"

  &#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> which are not
  satisfactorily treated in the ordinary sources of information; I regret
  that my space forbids me to attempt the elucidation of them. The student
  will find valuable aid in the notes of Madv. on the passages of the
  <i>D.F.</i> quoted in this note. <i>Non tam rebus quam vocabulis</i>:
  Cic. frequently repeats this assertion of Antiochus, who, having stolen
  the clothes of the Stoics, proceeded to prove that they had never
  properly belonged to the Stoics at all. <i>Inter recte factum atque
  peccatum</i>: Stob. speaks <span class="vol">II.</span> 6, 6 of <span

  praetermissaque</i>: MSS. have <i>et</i> before <i>servata</i>, which all
  edd. since Lamb. eject. Where <i>et</i> and <i>que</i> correspond in
  Cic., the <i>que</i> is always an afterthought, added in oblivion of the
  <i>et</i>. With two nouns, adjectives, adverbs, or participles, this
  oblivion is barely possible, but when the conjunctions go with separate
  <i>clauses</i> it is possible. Cf. <a href="#BkI_43">43</a> and

  certain excellences as perfected by the reason, or (as the case might be)
  by habit." <i>Ea genera virtutum</i>: both Plato and Arist. roughly
  divided the nature of man into two parts, the intellectual and the
  emotional, the former being made to govern, the latter to obey (cf.
  <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 47, and Arist. <span lang="el"

  &#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3B3;&#x3C9;&#x3B9;</span>); Zeno however asserted the

  (Zeller 203 sq.). Virtue also became for him one and indivisible (Zeller
  248, <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> <i>passim</i>). When the

  was vice or emotion. The battle between virtue and vice therefore did not
  resemble a war between two separate powers, as in Plato and Aristotle,
  but a civil war carried on in one and the same country. <i>Virtutis
  usum</i>: cf. the description of Aristotle's <i>finis</i> in <i>D.F.</i>
  <span class="vol">II.</span> 19. <i>Ipsum habitum</i>: the mere
  possession. So Plato, <i>Theaetet.</i> 197 B, uses the word <span
  lang="el" title="hexis" >&#x201B;&#x3B5;&#x3BE;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>, a
  use which must be clearly distinguished from the later sense found in the
  <i>Ethics</i> of Arist. In this sense virtue is <i>not</i> a <span

  <i>Perturbationem</i>: I am surprised that Halm after the fine note of
  Wesenberg, printed on p. 324 of the same volume in which Halm's text of
  the <i>Acad.</i> appears, should read the plural <i>perturbationes</i>, a
  conj. of Walker. <i>Perturbationem</i> means emotion in the abstract;
  <i>perturbationes</i> below, particular emotions. There is exactly the
  same transition in <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 23, 24,
  <span class="vol">IV.</span> 59, 65, <span class="vol">V.</span> 43,
  while <i>perturbatio</i> is used, in the same sense as here, in at least
  five other passages of the <i>T.D.</i>, i.e. <span class="vol">IV.</span>

  reason, and perfect reason being virtue (<a href="#BkI_20">20</a>), it
  follows that the Stoic sapiens must be emotionless (Zeller 228 sq.). All
  emotions are reasonless; <span lang="el" title="hêdonê"

  existence in <i>De Coelo</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 2, in a curious
  and recondite fashion. Cic. is certainly wrong in stating that Arist.
  derived <i>mind</i> from this fifth element, though the finest and
  highest of material substances. He always guards himself from assigning a
  material origin to mind. Cic. repeats the error in <i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 22, 41, 65, <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">IV.</span> 12. On this last passage Madv. has an important
  note, but he fails to recognise the essential fact, which is clear from
  Stob. <span class="vol">I.</span> 41, 33, that the Peripatetics of the
  time were in the habit of deriving the mind from <span lang="el"
  title="aithêr" >&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;</span>, which is the

  <i>De Coelo</i>), and of giving this out to be Aristotle's opinion. The
  error once made, no one could correct it, for there were a hundred
  influences at work to confirm it, while the works of Aristotle had fallen
  into a strange oblivion. I cannot here give an exhaustive account of
  these influences, but will mention a few. Stoicism had at the time
  succeeded in powerfully influencing every other sect, and it placed <span

  &#x3B5;&#x3BD; &#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;</span> (see

  Cic. had no means of knowing this (see Stob. <span class="vol">I.</span>

  the outer circle of the universe, as though to their natural home, just
  where Arist. placed his <span lang="el" title="pempton sôma"

  <span class="vol">I.</span> 43 with the <i>Somn. Scipionis</i> will see
  what power this had over Cicero. Further, Cic. would naturally link the
  mind in its origin with the stars which both Plato and Arist. looked on
  as divine (cf. <i>Somn. Scip.</i> 15) These considerations will be enough
  to show that neither Cic. nor Antiochus, whom Madv. considers responsible
  for the error, could have escaped it in any way not superhuman except by
  the recovery of Aristotle's lost works, which did not happen till too
  late. <i>Sensus</i>: we seem here to have a remnant of the distinction

  These notions came from Heraclitus who was a great hero of the Stoics
  (Zeller ch. <span class="vol">VIII.</span> with notes) For his view of
  sensation and thought see Sextus <i>Adv. Math.</i> <span

  probably misunderstood him; cf. R. and P. "Heraclitus," and Grote's
  <i>Plato</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 34 sq. <i>Expers corporis</i>:
  for Stoic materialism see Zeller, pp. 120 sq. The necessity of a

  Plato in the <i>Timaeus</i> fosters the same notion, though in a
  different way. The Stoics simply followed out boldly that line of
  thought. <i>Xenocrates</i>: see <span class="vol">II.</span> <a
  href="#BkIIN_124">124</a>, n. <i>Superiores</i>: merely the supposed old
  Academico-Peripatetic school. <i>Posse esse non corpus</i>: there is no

  <i>Iunctos</i>: how can anything be a <i>compound</i> of one thing? The
  notion that <i>iunctos</i> could mean <i>aptos</i> (R. and P. 366) is
  untenable. I entirely agree with Madv. (first Excursus to his
  <i>D.F.</i>) that we have here an anacoluthon. Cic. meant to say
  <i>iunctos e quadam impulsione et ex assensu animorum</i>, but having to

  obliged to break off and resume at <i>sed ad haec</i>. The explanation of
  a Greek term causes a very similar anacoluthon in <i>De Off.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 153. Schuppe, <i>De Anacoluthis Ciceronianis</i> p.
  9, agrees with Madv. For the expression cf. <i>D.F.</i> <span

  Zeller, ch. <span class="vol">V.</span>, R. and P. 365 sq. <i>Nos

  cf. <span class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_37">37</a>, <i>De

  but, as we shall see in the <i>Lucullus</i>, the sensation and the thing

  seen in several passages quoted by Zeller 80. <i>Ut convelli ratione non

  Later Stoics, however, allowed that some of them were not impervious to
  logical tests; see Sext. <i>Adv. Math.</i> <span class="vol">VII.</span>

  sceptical criticism before it could be believed. This was, as Zeller

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkI_43">§§43</a>&mdash;end.</b> Cicero's
  historical justification of the New Academy. Summary. Arcesilas'
  philosophy was due to no mere passion for victory in argument, but to the
  obscurity of phenomena, which had led the ancients to despair of
  knowledge (<a href="#BkI_44">44</a>). He even abandoned the one tenet
  held by Socrates to be certain; and maintained that since arguments of
  equal strength could be urged in favour of the truth or falsehood of
  phenomena, the proper course to take was to suspend judgment entirely (<a
  href="#BkI_45">45</a>). His views were really in harmony with those of
  Plato, and were carried on by Carneades (<a

<h3>NOTES ON THE FRAGMENTS.</h3>

<p class="center">BOOK I.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_1"></a><a href="#Fr_1">1</a>.</b> <i>Mnesarchus</i>:
  see <span class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_69">69</a>, <i>De Or.</i>
  <span class="vol">I.</span> 45, and <i>Dict. Biogr.</i> 'Antipater'; cf.
  <span class="vol">II.</span> <a href="#BkII_143">143</a>, <i>De Off.</i>
  <span class="vol">III.</span> 50. Evidently this fragment belongs to that
  historical justification of the New Academy with which I suppose Cicero
  to have concluded the first book.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_2"></a><a href="#Fr_2">2</a>.</b> The word
  <i>concinere</i> occurs <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">IV.</span> 60,
  <i>N.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 16, in both which places it is
  used of the Stoics, who are said <i>re concinere, verbis discrepare</i>
  with the other schools. This opinion of Antiochus Cic. had already
  mentioned <a href="#BkI_43">43</a>, and probably repeated in this
  fragment. Krische remarks that Augustine, <i>Cont. Acad.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 14, 15, seems to have imitated that part of
  Cicero's exposition to which this fragment belongs. If so Cic. must have
  condemned the unwarrantable verbal innovations of Zeno in order to excuse
  the extreme scepticism of Arcesilas (Krische, p. 58).</p>

<p class="center">BOOK II.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_3"></a><a href="#Fr_3">3</a>.</b> This fragm. clearly
  forms part of those anticipatory sceptical arguments which Cic. in the
  first edition had included in his answer to Hortensius, see Introd. p. <a
  href="#Page_lv">55</a>. The argument probably ran thus: What seems so
  level as the sea? Yet it is easy to prove that it is really not
  level.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_4"></a><a href="#Fr_4">4</a>.</b> On this I have
  nothing to remark.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_5"></a><a href="#Fr_5">5</a>.</b> There is nothing
  distinctive about this which might enable us to determine its connection
  with the dialogue. Probably Zeno is the person who <i>serius adamavit
  honores</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_6"></a><a href="#Fr_6">6</a>.</b> The changing aspects
  of the same thing are pointed to here as invalidating the evidence of the
  senses.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_7"></a><a href="#Fr_7">7</a>.</b> This passage has the
  same aim as the last and closely resembles <i>Lucullus</i> <a
  href="#BkII_105">105</a>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_8"></a><a href="#Fr_8">8</a>.</b> The fact that the
  eye and hand need such guides shows how untrustworthy the senses are. A
  similar argument occurs in <i>Luc.</i> <a href="#BkII_86">86</a>.
  <i>Perpendiculum</i> is a plumb line, <i>norma</i> a mason's square, the
  word being probably a corruption of the Greek <span lang="el"
  title="gnômôn" >&#x3B3;&#x3BD;&#x3C9;&#x3BC;&#x3C9;&#x3BD;</span> (Curt.
  <i>Grundz</i> p. 169, ed. 3), <i>regula</i>, a rule.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_9"></a><a href="#Fr_9">9</a>.</b> The different
  colours which the same persons show in different conditions, when young
  and when old, when sick and when healthy, when sober and when drunken,
  are brought forward to prove how little of permanence there is even in
  the least fleeting of the objects of sense.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_10"></a><a href="#Fr_10">10</a>.</b> <i>Urinari</i> is
  to dive; for the derivation see Curt. <i>Grundz</i> p. 326. A diver would
  be in exactly the position of the fish noticed in <i>Luc.</i> <a
  href="#BkII_81">81</a>, which are unable to see that which lies
  immediately above them and so illustrate the narrow limits of the power
  of vision.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_11"></a><a href="#Fr_11">11</a>.</b> Evidently an
  attempt to prove the sense of smell untrustworthy. Different people pass
  different judgments on one and the same odour. The student will observe
  that the above extracts formed part of an argument intended to show the
  deceptive character of the senses. To these should probably be added
  fragm. <a href="#Fr_32">32</a>. Fr. <a href="#Fr_19">19</a> shows that
  the impossibility of distinguishing eggs one from another, which had been
  brought forward in the <i>Catulus</i>, was allowed to stand in the second
  edition, other difficulties of the kind, such as those connected with the
  bent oar, the pigeon's neck, the twins, the impressions of seals
  (<i>Luc.</i> <a href="#BkII_19">19</a>, <a href="#BkII_54">54</a>), would
  also appear in both editions. The result of these assaults on the senses
  must have been summed up in the phrase <i>cuncta dubitanda esse</i> which
  Augustine quotes from the <i>Academica Posteriora</i> (see fragm. <a
  href="#Fr_36">36</a>).</p>

<p class="center">BOOK III.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_12"></a><a href="#Fr_12">12</a>.</b> This forms part
  of Varro's answer to Cicero, which corresponded in substance to Lucullus'
  speech in the <i>Academica Priora</i> The drift of this extract was most
  likely this: just as there is a limit beyond which the battle against
  criminals cannot be maintained, so after a certain point we must cease to
  fight against perverse sceptics and let them take their own way. See
  another view in Krische, p. 62.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_13"></a><a href="#Fr_13">13</a>.</b> Krische believes
  that this fragment formed part of an attempt to show that the senses were
  trustworthy, in the course of which the clearness with which the fishes
  were seen leaping from the water was brought up as evidence. (In
  <i>Luc.</i> <a href="#BkII_81">81</a>, on the other hand, Cic. drew an
  argument hostile to the senses from the consideration of the fish.) The
  explanation seems to me very improbable. The words bear such a striking
  resemblance to those in <i>Luc.</i> <a href="#BkII_125">125</a> (<i>ut
  nos nunc simus ad Baulos Puteolosque videmus, sic innumerabilis paribus
  in locis esse isdem de rebus disputantis</i>) that I am inclined to think
  that the reference in Nonius ought to be to Book <span
  class="vol">IV.</span> and not Book <span class="vol">III.</span>, and
  that Cic., when he changed the scene from Bauli to the Lucrine lake, also
  changed <i>Puteolosque</i> into <i>pisciculosque exultantes</i> for the
  sufficient reason that Puteoli was not visible from Varro's villa on the
  Lucrine.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_14"></a><a href="#Fr_14">14</a>.</b> The passion for
  knowledge in the human heart was doubtless used by Varro as an argument
  in favour of assuming absolute knowledge to be attainable. The same line
  is taken in <i>Luc.</i> <a href="#BkII_31">31</a>, <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 17, and elsewhere.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_15"></a><a href="#Fr_15">15</a>.</b> It is so much
  easier to find parallels to this in Cicero's speech than in that of
  Lucullus in the <i>Academica Priora</i> that I think the reference in
  Nonius must be wrong. The talk about freedom suits a sceptic better than
  a dogmatist (see <i>Luc.</i> <a href="#BkII_105">105</a>, <a
  href="#BkII_120">120</a>, and Cic.'s words in <a href="#BkII_8">8</a> of
  the same). If my conjecture is right this fragment belongs to Book <span
  class="vol">IV.</span> Krische gives a different opinion, but very
  hesitatingly, p. 63.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_16"></a><a href="#Fr_16">16</a>.</b> This may well
  have formed part of Varro's explanation of the <span lang="el"
  title="katalêpsis"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C8;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>,
  <i>temeritas</i> being as much deprecated by the Antiocheans and Stoics
  as by the Academics cf. <span class="vol">I.</span> <a
  href="#BkI_42">42</a>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_17"></a><a href="#Fr_17">17</a>.</b> I conjecture
  <i>malleo</i> (a hammer) for the corrupt <i>malcho</i>, and think that in
  the second ed. some comparison from building operations to illustrate the
  fixity of knowledge gained through the <span lang="el"
  title="katalêpseis"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C8;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>
  was added to a passage which would correspond in substance with <a
  href="#BkII_27">27</a> of the <i>Lucullus</i>. I note in Vitruvius,
  quoted by Forc. s.v. <i>malleolus</i>, a similar expression (<i>naves
  malleolis confixae</i>) and in Pliny <i>Nat. Hist.</i> <span
  class="vol">XXXIV.</span> 14 <i>navis fixa malleo</i>. <i>Adfixa</i>
  therefore in this passage must have agreed with some lost noun either in
  the neut. plur. or fem. sing.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_18"></a><a href="#Fr_18">18</a>.</b> This and fragm.
  <a href="#Fr_19">19</a> evidently hang very closely together. As Krische
  notes, the Stoic <span lang="el" title="enargeia"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B3;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> had
  evidently been translated earlier in the book by <i>perspicuitas</i> as
  in <i>Luc.</i> <a href="#BkII_17">17</a>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_19"></a><a href="#Fr_19">19</a>.</b> See on
  <i>Luc.</i> <a href="#BkIIN_57">57</a>.</p>

<p class="center">BOOK IV.</p>

  <p>Further information on all these passages will be found in my notes on
  the parallel passages of the <i>Lucullus</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_21"></a><a href="#Fr_21">21</a>.</b> <i>Viam</i>
  evidently a mistake for the <i>umbram</i> of <i>Luc.</i> <a
  href="#BkII_70">70</a>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_23"></a><a href="#Fr_23">23</a>.</b> The best MS. of
  Nonius points to <i>flavum</i> for <i>ravum</i> (<i>Luc.</i> <a
  href="#BkII_105">105</a>). Most likely an alteration was made in the
  second edition, as Krische supposes, p. 64.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_28"></a><a href="#Fr_28">28</a>.</b>
  <i>Corpusculis</i>: <i>Luc.</i> <a href="#BkII_121">121</a> has
  <i>corporibus</i>. Krische's opinion that this latter word was in the
  second edition changed into the former may be supported from <span
  class="vol">I.</span> <a href="#BkI_6">6</a>, which he does not notice.
  The conj. is confirmed by Aug. <i>Contr. Ac.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 23.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_29"></a><a href="#Fr_29">29</a>.</b> <i>Magnis
  obscurata</i>: in <i>Luc.</i> <a href="#BkII_122">122</a> it is
  <i>crassis occultata</i>, so that we have another alteration, see
  Krische, p. 64.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_30"></a><a href="#Fr_30">30</a>.</b> Only slight
  differences appear in the MSS. of the <i>Luc.</i> <a
  href="#BkII_123">123</a>, viz. <i>contraria</i>, for <i>in c.</i>, <i>ad
  vestigia</i> for <i>contra v.</i></p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_31"></a><a href="#Fr_31">31</a>.</b> <i>Luc.</i> <a
  href="#BkII_137">137</a> has <i>dixi</i> for <i>dictus</i>. As Cic. does
  not often leave out <i>est</i> with the passive verb, Nonius has probably
  quoted wrongly. It will be noted that the fragments of Book <span
  class="vol">III.</span> correspond to the first half of the <i>Luc.</i>,
  those of Book <span class="vol">IV.</span> to the second half. Cic.
  therefore divided the <i>Luc.</i> into two portions at or about <a
  href="#BkII_63">63</a>.</p>

<p class="center">UNCERTAIN BOOKS.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_32"></a><a href="#Fr_32">32</a>.</b> I have already
  said that this most likely belonged to the preliminary assault on the
  senses made by Cic. in the second book.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_33"></a><a href="#Fr_33">33</a>.</b> In the Introd. p.
  <a href="#Page_lv">55</a> I have given my opinion that the substance of
  Catulus' speech which unfolded the doctrine of the <i>probabile</i> was
  incorporated with Cicero's speech in the second book of this edition. To
  that part this fragment must probably be referred.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_34"></a><a href="#Fr_34">34</a>.</b> This important
  fragment clearly belongs to Book <span class="vol">II.</span>, and is a
  jocular application of the Carneadean <i>probabile</i>, as may be seen
  from the words <i>probabiliter posse confici</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_35"></a><a href="#Fr_35">35</a>.</b> Krische assigns
  this to the end of Varro's speech in the third Book. With this opinion I
  find it quite impossible to agree. A passage in the <i>Lucullus</i> (<a
  href="#BkII_60">60</a>) proves to demonstration that in the first edition
  this allusion to the esoteric teaching of the Academy could only have
  occurred either in the speech of Catulus or in that of Cicero. As no
  reason whatever appears to account for its transference to Varro I prefer
  to regard it as belonging to Cic.'s exposition of the positive side of
  Academic doctrine in the second book. Cic. repeatedly insists that the
  Academic school must not be supposed to have no truths to maintain, see
  <i>Luc.</i> <a href="#BkII_119">119</a>, also <a href="#BkII_66">66</a>
  and <i>N.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 12. Also Aug. <i>Contra.
  Ac.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 29.</p>

  <p><b><a name="FrN_36"></a><a href="#Fr_36">36</a>.</b> It is difficult
  to see where this passage could have been included if not in that
  prooemium to the third book which is mentioned <i>Ad. Att.</i> <span
  class="vol">XVI.</span> 6, 4. I may here add that Krische seems to me
  wrong in holding that the whole four books formed one discussion,
  finished within the limits of a single day. Why interrupt the discussion
  by the insertion of a prologue of so general a nature as to be taken from
  a stock which Cic. kept on hand ready made? (Cf. <i>Ad Att.</i> as
  above.)</p>

<hr />

  <p>Besides the actual fragments of the second edition, many indications
  of its contents are preserved in the work of Augustine entitled <i>Contra
  Academicos</i>, which, though written in support of dogmatic opinions,
  imitated throughout the second edition of the <i>Academica</i> of Cic. No
  writings of the Classical period had so great an influence on the culture
  and opinions of Augustine as the <i>Academica</i> and the lost
  <i>Hortensius</i>. I give, partly from Krische, the scattered indications
  of the contents of the former which are to be gathered from the bishop's
  works. In Aug. <i>Contr. Ac.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 14, 15, we
  have what appears to be a summary of the lost part of Book <span
  class="vol">I.</span> to the following effect. The New Academy must not
  be regarded as having revolted against the Old, all that it did was to
  discuss that new doctrine of <span lang="el" title="katalêpsis"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C8;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>
  advanced by Zeno. The doctrine of <span lang="el" title="akatalêpsia"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C8;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>
  though present to the minds of the ancients had never taken distinct
  shape, because it had met with no opposition. The Old Academy was rather
  enriched than attacked by the New. Antiochus, in adopting Stoicism under
  the name of the Old Academy, made it appear that there was a strife
  between it and the New. With Antiochus the historical exposition of Cic.
  must have ended. From this portion of the first book, Aug. derived his
  opinion (<i>Contra. Ac.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 1) that New
  Academicism was excusable from the necessities of the age in which it
  appeared. Indications of Book <span class="vol">II.</span> in Aug. are
  scarce, but to it I refer <i>Contra. Ac.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span>
  7 <i>placuit Ciceroni nostro beatum esse qui verum investigat etiam si ad
  eius inventionem non valeat pervenire</i>, also <i>ibid.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 10 <i>illis (Academicis) placuit esse posse
  hominem sapientem, et tamen in hominem scientiam cadere non posse</i>.
  These I refer to Cicero's development of the <i>probabile</i> in Book
  <span class="vol">II.</span>, although I ought to say that Krische, p.
  65, maintains that the substance of Catulus' exposition in the <i>Ac.
  Priora</i> transferred to Book <span class="vol">IV.</span> of the <i>Ac.
  Posteriora</i>. As this would leave very meagre material for Book <span
  class="vol">II.</span>, nothing indeed excepting the provisional proof of
  the deceptiveness of the senses, I cannot accede to his arrangement;
  mine, I may remark, involves a much smaller departure from the first
  edition. Allusions in Aug. to the attack on the senses by Cic. in Book
  <span class="vol">II.</span> are difficult to fix, as they apply equally
  well to the later attack in Book <span class="vol">IV.</span> As to Books
  <span class="vol">III.</span> and <span class="vol">IV.</span>, I do not
  think it necessary here to prove from Aug. the points of agreement
  between them and the <i>Lucullus</i>, which will find a better place in
  my notes on the latter, but merely give the divergences which appear from
  other sources. These are the translation of <span lang="el"

  >&#x3C3;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>

<h3>BOOK II.</h3>

<p class="center">ENTITLED <i>LUCULLUS</i>.</p>

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkII_1">§§1</a>&mdash;<a
  href="#BkII_12">12</a>.</b> Summary. Lucullus, though an able and
  cultivated man, was absent from Rome on public service too long during
  his earlier years to attain to glory in the forum (<a
  href="#BkII_1">1</a>). He unexpectedly proved a great general. This was
  due to his untiring study and his marvellous memory (<a
  href="#BkII_2">2</a>). He had to wait long for the reward of his merits
  as a commander and civil administrator, and was allowed no triumph till
  just before my consulship. What I owed to him in those troublous times I
  cannot now tell (<a href="#BkII_3">3</a>). He was not merely a general;
  he was also a philosopher, having learned much from Antiochus and read
  much for himself (<a href="#BkII_4">4</a>). Those enemies of Greek
  culture who think a Roman noble ought not to know philosophy, must be
  referred to the examples of Cato and Africanus (<a href="#BkII_5">5</a>).
  Others think that famous men should not be introduced into dialogues of
  the kind. Are they then, when they meet, to be silent or to talk about
  trifles? I, in applying myself to philosophy, have neglected no public
  duty, nor do I think the fame of illustrious citizens diminished, but
  enriched, by a reputation for philosophical knowledge (<a
  href="#BkII_6">6</a>). Those who hold that the interlocutors in these
  dialogues had no such knowledge show that they can make their envy reach
  beyond the grave. Some critics do not approve the particular philosophy
  which I follow&mdash;the Academic. This is natural, but they must know
  that Academicism puts no stop to inquiry (<a href="#BkII_7">7</a>). My
  school is free from the fetters of dogma; other schools are enslaved to
  authority (<a href="#BkII_8">8</a>). The dogmatists say they bow to the
  authority of the wise man. How can they find out the wise man without
  hearing all opinions? This subject was discussed by myself, Catulus,
  Lucullus, and Hortensius, the day after the discussion reported in the
  <i>Catulus</i> (<a href="#BkII_9">9</a>). Catulus called on Lucullus to
  defend the doctrines of Antiochus. This Lucullus believed himself able to
  do, although the doctrines had suffered in the discussion of the day
  before (<a href="#BkII_10">10</a>). He spoke thus: At Alexandria I heard
  discussions between Heraclitus Tyrius the pupil of Clitomachus and Philo,
  and Antiochus. At that very time the books mentioned by Catulus yesterday
  came into the hands of Antiochus, who was so angry that he wrote a book
  against his old teacher (<a href="#BkII_11">11</a> and <a
  href="#BkII_12">12</a>). I will now give the substance of the disputes
  between Heraclitus and Antiochus, omitting the remarks made by the latter
  against Philo (<a href="#BkII_12">12</a>).</blockquote>

  <p><b><a name="BkIIN_1"></a><a href="#BkII_1">§1</a>.</b> <i>Luculli</i>:
  see Introd. p. <a href="#Page_lviii">58</a>, and <i>Dict. Biog.</i>
  <i>Digna homini nobili</i>: a good deal of learning would have been
  considered <i>unworthy</i> of a man like Lucullus, see Introd. p. <a
  href="#Page_xxx">30</a>. <i>Percepta</i>: "gained," "won;" cf.
  <i>percipere fruges</i>, "to reap," <i>Cat. Mai.</i> 24. <i>Caruit</i>:
  "was cut off from;" <i>carere</i> comes from a root <i>skar</i> meaning
  to divide, see Corss. <span class="vol">I.</span> 403. For the three
  nouns with a singular verb see Madv. <i>Gram.</i> 213 A, who confines the
  usage to nouns denoting things and impersonal ideas. If the common
  reading <i>dissensit</i> in <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span>
  68 is right, the restriction does not hold. <i>Admodum</i>: "to a
  degree." <i>Fratre</i>: this brother was adopted by a M. Terentius Varro,
  and was a man of distinction also; see <i>Dict. Biog.</i> <i>Magna cum
  gloria</i>: a ref. to <i>Dict. Biog.</i> will show that the whole affair
  was discreditable to the father; to our notions, the sons would have
  gained greater glory by letting it drop. <i>Quaestor</i>: to Sulla, who
  employed him chiefly in the civil administration of Asia.
  <i>Continuo</i>: without any interval. <i>Legis praemio</i>: this seems
  to mean "by the favour of a special law," passed of course by Sulla, who
  had restored the old <i>lex annalis</i> in all its rigour, and yet
  excepted his own officers from its operation. <i>Prooemio</i>, which has
  been proposed, would not be Latin, see <i>De Leg.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 16. <i>Consulatum</i>: he seems to have been
  absent during the years 84&mdash;74, in the East. <i>Superiorum</i>:
  scarcely that of Sulla.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIIN_2"></a><a href="#BkII_2">§2</a>.</b> <i>Laus</i>:
  "merit," as often, so <i>praemium</i>, Virg. <i>Aen.</i> <span
  class="vol">XII.</span> 437, means a deed worthy of reward. <i>Non
  admodum exspectabatur</i>: Cic. forgets that Luc. had served with
  distinction in the Social War and the first Mithridatic war. <i>In Asia
  pace</i>: three good MSS. have <i>Asiae</i>; Baiter ejects <i>Asia</i>;
  Guilelmus read <i>in Asia in pace</i> (which Davies conjectures, though
  he prints <i>Asiae</i>). <i>Consumere</i> followed by an ablative without
  <i>in</i> is excessively rare in Cic. Madv. <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">V.</span> 53 denies the use altogether. In addition, however,
  to our passage, I note <i>hoc loco consumitur</i> in <i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">IV.</span> 23, where Baiter's two texts (1861 and 1863) give
  no variants. <i>Pace</i> here perhaps ought to be taken adverbially, like
  <i>tranqullo</i>. <i>Indocilem</i>: this is simply passive, = "untaught,"
  as in Prop. <span class="vol">I.</span> 2, 12, Ov. <i>Fast.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 119 (the last qu. by Dav.). Forc. s.v. is wrong
  in making it active. <i>Factus</i>: = <i>perfectus</i>; cf. Hor.
  <i>Sat.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 5, 33 <i>homo factus ad
  unguem</i>, Cic. <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 184, <i>In
  Verr.</i> <span class="vol">IV.</span> 126. So <i>effectus</i> in silver
  Latin. <i>Rebus gestis</i>: military history, so often. <i>Divinam
  quandam memoriam</i>: the same phrase in <i>De Or.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 360. <i>Rerum, verborum</i>: same distinction in
  <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 359. <i>Oblivisci se
  malle</i>: the same story is told <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 104, <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span>
  299. The ancient art of memory was begun by Simonides (who is the person
  denoted here by <i>cuidam</i>) and completed by Metrodorus of Scepsis,
  for whom see <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 360.
  <i>Consignamus</i>: cf. <i>consignatae in animis notiones</i> in
  <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 57. <i>litteris</i> must be an
  ablative of the instrument. <i>Mandare monum.</i>: cf. <span
  class="vol">I.</span> <a href="#BkI_3">3</a>. <i>Insculptas</i>: rare in
  the metaphorical use, cf. <i>N.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 45.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIIN_3"></a><a href="#BkII_3">§3</a>.</b> <i>Genere</i>:
  "department" cf. <span class="vol">I.</span> <a href="#BkI_3">3</a>.
  <i>Navalibus pugnis</i>: <span lang="el" title="naumachiais"
  >&#x3BD;&#x3B1;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B1;&#x3C7;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;&#x3B9;&#x3C2;</span>.
  <i>Instrumento et adparatu</i>: <span lang="el" title="kataskeuê kai paraskeuê"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3B7;

  &#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3B7;</span>.
  <i>Rex</i>: Mithridates. <i>Quos legisset</i>: = <i>de quibus l.</i>; cf.
  the use of the passive verb so common in Ovid, e.g. <i>Trist.</i> <span
  class="vol">IV.</span> 4, 14. I take of course <i>rex</i> to be nom. to
  <i>legisset</i>, the suggestion of a friend that Lucullus is nom. and
  that <i>quos legisset</i> = <i>quorum commentarios legisset</i> I think
  improbable. <i>Hodie</i>: Drakenborch on Livy <span class="vol">V.</span>
  27 wants to read <i>hodieque</i>, which however, is not Ciceronian. In
  passages like <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 103 and
  <i>Verr.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span> 64, the <i>que</i> connects
  clauses and does not modify <i>hodie</i>. On this subject see Madv.
  <i>Opuscula</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 390. <i>Etsi</i>:
  <i>M.D.F.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span> 68, shows that in Cic. a
  parenthetic clause with <i>etsi</i> always has a common verb with its
  principal clause; a rule not observed by the silver writers. The same
  holds of <i>quamquam</i>, see n. on <span class="vol">I.</span> <a
  href="#BkIN_5">5</a>. <i>Calumnia</i>: properly a fraudulent use of
  litigation, <span lang="el" title="sykophantia"
  >&#x3C3;&#x3C5;&#x3BA;&#x3BF;&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span>.
  The chief enemy was the infamous Memmius who prosecuted him. <i>In
  urbem</i>: until his triumph Luc. would remain outside the city.
  <i>Profuisset</i>: this ought properly to be <i>profuerit</i>, but the
  conditional <i>dicerem</i> changes it. <i>Potius ... quam ...
  communicem</i>: n. on <a href="#BkIIN_23">23</a>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIIN_4"></a><a href="#BkII_4">§4</a>.</b> <i>Sunt ...

  <a href="#BkI_17">17</a> for the collocation of the words. <i>Externa ...
  interiora</i>: cf. <i>De Div.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 124 <i>sed
  haec quoque in promptu, nunc interiora videamus</i>. <i>Pro
  quaestore</i>: for this Faber wrote <i>quaestor</i>, arguing that as Luc.
  was Sulla's <i>quaestor</i> and Sulla sent him to Egypt, he could not be
  <i>pro quaestor</i>. But surely after the first year he would be <i>pro
  quaestor</i>. Dav. reads <i>quaestor</i> here and <a
  href="#BkII_11">11</a>, saying "<i>veterem lectionem iugulavit
  Faber</i>". <i>Ea memoria ... quam</i>: Bentl., Halm, Baiter give
  <i>qua</i>, Halm refers to Bentl. on Hor. <i>Sat.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 6, 15. A passage like ours is <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 29, <i>ista sis aequitate, quam ostendis</i>, where
  one MS. has <i>qua</i>. Read Madvig's lucid note there. <i>De quibus
  audiebat</i>: Madv. <i>Em.</i> 121 makes this equivalent to <i>de eis
  rebus de quibus</i>, the necessity of which explanation, though approved
  by Halm, I fail to see. The form of expression is very common in Cic.,
  and the relative always refers to an actually expressed antecedent, cf.
  e.g. <i>Cat. Mai.</i> 83. I take <i>quibus</i> as simply =
  <i>libris</i>.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIIN_5"></a><a href="#BkII_5">§5</a>.</b> <i>Ac</i>:

  <i>dittographia</i>, as I think, though Halm, as well as Bait., retains
  it. On the retention or omission of this <i>qui</i> will depend the
  choice of <i>putant</i> or <i>putent</i> below. <i>Earum rerum

  loquantur</i>: <i>hist.</i> means in Cic. rather "memoirs" than
  "history," which is better expressed by <i>res gestae</i>. Note that the

  <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 7 <i>nihil operae reipublicae

  <i>detrahens</i>. <i>Nisi forensem</i>: the early oratorical works may
  fairly be said to have this character; scarcely, however, the <i>De

  57, Hortensius 50. <i>Contra omnis dicere quae videntur</i>: MSS. mostly
  insert <i>qui</i> between <i>dicere</i> and <i>quae</i>, one of the best
  however has <i>dicere quae aliis</i> as a correction, while another has
  the marginal reading <i>qui scire sibi videntur</i>. The omission of
  <i>qui</i>, which I conjectured, but now see occurs in a MS. (Pal. 2)

  latter in <i>De Haruspicum Responsis</i> 60, but the last of these two

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkII_13">§§13</a>&mdash;<a
  href="#BkII_18">18</a>.</b> Summary. Cicero seems to me to have acted
  like a seditious tribune, in appealing to famous old philosophers as
  supporters of scepticism (<a href="#BkII_13">13</a>), Those very
  philosophers, with the exception of Empedocles, seem to me, if anything,
  too dogmatic (<a href="#BkII_14">14</a>). Even if they were often in
  doubt, do you suppose that no advance has been made during so many
  centuries by the investigations of so many men of ability? Arcesilas was
  a rebel against a good philosophy, just as Ti. Gracchus was a rebel
  against a good government (<a href="#BkII_15">15</a>). Has nothing really
  been learned since the time of Arcesilas? His opinions have had scanty,
  though brilliant support (<a href="#BkII_16">16</a>). Now many dogmatists
  think that no argument ought to be held with a sceptic, since argument
  can add nothing to the innate clearness of true sensations (<a
  href="#BkII_17">17</a>). Most however do allow of discussion with
  sceptics. Philo in his innovations was induced to state falsehoods, and
  incurred all the evils he wished to avoid, his rejection of Zeno's
  definition of the <span lang="el" title="katalêptikê phantasia"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;
  &#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> really
  led him back to that utter scepticism from which he was fleeing. We then
  must either maintain Zeno's definition or give in to the sceptics (<a
  href="#BkII_18">18</a>).</blockquote>

  <i>Ii a</i>: so Dav. for MSS. <i>iam</i>. <i>Tum ad hos</i>: so MSS.,
  Dav. <i>aut hos</i>. The omission of the verb <i>venire</i> is very
  common in Cic.'s letters. <i>C. Flaminium</i>: the general at lake
  Trasimene. <i>Aliquot annis</i>: one good MS. has <i>annos</i>, cf.
  <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 4, where all the best MSS. have
  <i>annos</i>. The ablative is always used to express point of time, and
  indeed it may be doubted whether the best writers <i>ever</i> use any
  accusative in that sense, though they do occasionally use the ablative to
  express duration (cf. Prop. <span class="vol">I.</span> 6, 7 and Madv.
  <i>Gram.</i> 235, 2). <i>L. Cassium</i>: this is L. Cassius Longinus
  Ravilla, a man of good family, who carried a ballot bill (<i>De Leg.</i>
  <span class="vol">III.</span> 35), he was the author of the <i>cui
  bono</i> principle and so severe a judge as to be called <i>scopulus
  reorum</i>. Pompeium: apparently the man who made the disgraceful treaty
  with Numantia repudiated by home in 139 B.C. <i>P. Africanum</i>: i.e.
  the younger, who supported the ballot bill of Cassius, but seems to have
  done nothing else for the democrats. <i>Fratres</i>: Lamb. <i>viros</i>,
  but cf. <i>Brut.</i> 98. <i>P. Scaevolam</i>: the pontifex, consul in the
  year Tib. Gracchus was killed, when he refused to use violence against
  the tribunes. The only connection these brothers had with the schemes of
  Gracchus seems to be that they were consulted by him as lawyers, about
  the legal effect the bills would have. <i>Ut videmus ... ut
  suspicantur</i>: Halm with Gruter brackets these words on the ground that
  the statement about Marius implies that the demagogues lie about all but
  him. Those words need not imply so much, and if they did, Cic. may be
  allowed the inconsistency.</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIIN_14"></a><a href="#BkII_14">§14</a>.</b>
  <i>Similiter</i>: it is noticeable that five MSS. of Halm have
  <i>simile</i>. <i>Xenophanem</i>: so Victorius for the MSS.
  <i>Xenoplatonem</i>. <i>Ed. Rom.</i> (1471) has <i>Cenonem</i>, which
  would point to <i>Zenonem</i>, but Cic. does not often name Zeno of Elea.
  <i>Saturninus</i>: of the question why he was an enemy of Lucullus, Goer.
  says <i>frustra quaeritur</i>. Saturninus was the persistent enemy of
  Metellus Numidicus, who was the uncle of Lucullus by marriage.
  <i>Arcesilae calumnia</i>: this was a common charge, cf. <i>Academicorum
  calumnia</i> in <i>N.D.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 20 and
  <i>calumnia</i> in <a href="#BkII_18">18</a> and <a
  href="#BkII_65">65</a> of this book. So August. <i>Contra Acad.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 1 speaks of <i>Academicorum vel calumnia vel
  pertinacia vel pericacia</i>. <i>Democriti verecundia</i>: Cic. always
  has a kind of tenderness for Democritus, as Madv. on <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 20 remarks, cf. <i>De Div.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 30 where Democr. is made an exception to the
  general <i>arrogantia</i> of the <i>physici</i>. <i>Empedocles quidem ...
  videatur</i>: cf. <a href="#BkII_74">74</a>. The exordium of his poem is
  meant, though there is nothing in it so strong as the words of the text,
  see R. and P. 108. <i>Quale sit</i>: the emphasis is on <i>sit</i>, the
  sceptic regards only phenomenal, not essential existence. <i>Quasi modo
  nascentes</i>: Ciacconus thought this spurious, cf. however <i>T.D.</i>
  <span class="vol">II.</span> 5 <i>ut oratorum laus ... senescat ... ,
  philosophia nascatur</i>.</p>

  <i>Delitisceret</i>: this is the right spelling, not <i>delitesceret</i>,
  which one good MS. has here, see Corssen <span class="vol">II.</span>
  285. <i>Negavissent</i>: "had denied, as they said." <i>Tollendus
  est</i>: a statement which is criticised in <a href="#BkII_74">74</a>.
  <i>Nominibus differentis ... dissenserunt</i>: genuine Antiochean
  opinions, see the <i>Academica Posteriora</i> <a href="#BkI_17">17</a>,
  <a href="#BkI_43">43</a>. <i>De se ipse</i>: very frequent in Cic. (cf.
  Madv. <i>Gram.</i> 487 <i>b</i>). <i>Diceret</i>: this is omitted by the
  MSS., but one has <i>agnosceret</i> on the margin; see n. on <a
  href="#BkIIN_88">88</a>. <i>Fannius</i>: in his "Annals." The same
  statement is quoted in <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">II.</span> 270,
  <i>Brutus</i> 299. Brutus had written an epitome of this work of Fannius
  (<i>Ad Att.</i> <span class="vol">XII.</span> 5, 3).</p>

  <p><b><a name="BkIIN_16"></a><a href="#BkII_16">§16</a>.</b>
  <i>Veteribus</i>: Bentley's em. of MSS. <i>vetera</i>: C.F. Hermann
  (Schneid <i>Philol.</i> <span class="vol">VII.</span> 457), thinking the
  departure from the MSS. too great, keeps <i>vetera</i> and changes
  <i>incognita</i> into <i>incondita</i>, comparing <i>De Or.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 197, <span class="vol">III.</span> 173. A glance,
  however, at the exx. in Forc. will show that the word always means merely
  "disordered, confused" in Cic. The difference here is not one between
  order and no order, but between knowledge and no knowledge, so that
  <i>incognita</i> is far better. I am not at all certain that the MSS.
  reading needs alteration. If kept the sense would be: "but let us
  suppose, for sake of argument, that the doctrines of the ancients were
  not <i>knowledge</i>, but mere <i>opinion</i>." The conj. of Kayser
  <i>veri nota</i> for <i>vetera</i> (cf. <a href="#BkII_76">76</a>) and
  <i>investigatum</i> below, is fanciful and improbable. <i>Quod
  investigata sunt</i>: "in that an investigation was made." Herm. again
  disturbs the text which since Madv. <i>Em.</i> 127 supported it (quoting
  <i>T.D.</i> <span class="vol">V.</span> 15, Liv. <span
  class="vol">XXXV.</span> 16) had been settled. Holding that <i>illa</i>
  in the former sentence cannot be the subj. of the verb, he rashly ejects
  <i>nihilne est igitur actum</i> as a dittographia (!) from <a
  href="#BkII_15">15</a> <i>nihilne explicatum</i>, and reads <i>quot</i>
  for <i>quod</i> with Bentl. For the meaning cf. <i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 69 and Arist. on the progress of philosophy as
  there quoted. <i>Arcesilas Zenoni ... obtrectans</i>: see n. on <span
  class="vol">I.</span> <a href="#BkIN_34">34</a>. These charges were
  brought by each school against the other. In Plutarch <i>Adv. Colotem</i>
  p. 1121 F, want of novelty is charged against Arcesilas, and the charge
  is at once joyfully accepted by Plut. The scepticism of Arcesilas was
  often excused by the provocation Zeno gave, see Aug. <i>Contra Acad.</i>
  <span class="vol">II.</span> 14, 15 and notes on fragm. <a
  href="#FrN_2">2</a> and <a href="#FrN_35">35</a> of the <i>Academica
  Posteriora</i>. <i>Immutatione verborum</i>: n. on <span

  technical meanings; it translates the Greek <span lang="el"

  <i>tenebrae quae patronae Academicorum solent esse</i>. <i>Non admodum
  probata</i>: cf. the passage of Polybius qu. by Zeller 533.
  <i>Lacyde</i>: the most important passages in ancient authorities
  concerning him are quoted by Zeller 506. It is important to note that
  Arcesilas left no writings so that Lacydes became the source of
  information about his teacher's doctrines. <i>Tenuit</i>: cf. the use of
  <i>obtinere</i> in <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 45. <i>In
  Aeschine</i>: so Dav. for the confused MSS. reading. For this philosopher
  see Zeller 533. As two MSS. have <i>hac nonne</i> Christ conj.
  <i>Hagnone</i> which Halm, as well as Baiter takes; Zeller 533 seems to
  adopt this and at once confuses the supposed philosopher with one Agnon
  just mentioned in Quint. <span class="vol">II.</span> 17, 15. There is
  not the slightest reason for this, Agnon and Hagnon being known, if known
  at all, from these two passages only.</p>

  is worth remarking (as Petrus Valentia did, p. 290 of Orelli's reprint of
  his <i>Academica</i>) that Cic. omits to represent the words <span

  <span class="vol">II.</span> 11 quotes Cicero's definition and condenses
  it thus; <i>his signis verum posse comprehendi quae signa non potest
  habere quod falsum est</i>. <i>Iudicium</i>: <span lang="el"
  title="kritêrion"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C4;&#x3B7;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span>,
  a test to distinguish between the unknown and the known. <i>Eo, quo
  minime volt</i>: several things are clear, (1) that Philo headed a
  reaction towards dogmatism, (2) that he based the possibility of
  knowledge on a ground quite different from the <span lang="el"
  title="katalêptikê phantasia"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;

  pronounced impossible, (3) that he distorted the views of Carneades to
  suit his own. As to (1) all ancient testimony is clear, cf. <a
  href="#BkII_11">11</a>, Sextus <i>Pyrr. Hyp.</i> <span
  class="vol">I.</span> 235, who tells us that while the Carneadeans
  believed all things to be <span lang="el" title="akatalêpta"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>,
  Philo held them to be <span lang="el" title="katalêpta"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;</span>,
  and Numenius in Euseb. <i>Praep. Ev.</i> <span class="vol">XIV.</span> 8,
  p. 739, who treats him throughout his notice as a renegade. (2) is
  evident from the <i>Academica</i> and from Sextus as quoted above. The
  foundation for knowledge which he substituted is more difficult to
  comprehend. Sextus indeed tells us that he held things to be <i>in their
  own nature</i> <span lang="el" title="katalêpta (hoson de epi tê physei tôn pragmatôn autôn katal.)"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;

  would not have attempted to disprove this; they never tried to show that
  things <i>in themselves</i> were incognisable, <i>but</i> that human
  faculties do not avail to give information about them. Unless therefore
  Philo deluded himself with words, there was nothing new to him about such
  a doctrine. The Stoics by their <span lang="el" title="katalêptikê phantasia"
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;&#x3B7;&#x3C0;&#x3C4;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;
  &#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;</span> professed
  to be able to get at <i>the thing in itself</i>, in its real being, if
  then Philo did away with the <span lang="el" title="katal. phant."
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;.
  &#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;.</span> and substituted no other mode of
  curing the defects alleged by Arcesilas and Carneades to reside in sense,
  he was fairly open to the retort of Antiochus given in the text. Numenius
  treats his polemic against the <span lang="el" title="katal. phant."
  >&#x3BA;&#x3B1;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BB;.
  &#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;.</span> as a mere feint intended to cover
  his retreat towards dogmatism. A glimpse of his position is afforded in
  <a href="#BkII_112">112</a> of this book, where we may suppose Cic. to be
  expressing the views of Philo, and not those of Clitomachus as he usually
  does. It would seem from that passage that he defined the cognisable to
  be "<i>quod impressum esset e vero</i>" (<span lang="el" title="phantasia apo hyparchontos enapomemagmenê"
  >&#x3C6;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3B1;

  refusing to add "<i>quo modo imprimi non posset a falso</i> (<span
  lang="el" title="hoia ouk an genoito apo mê hyparchontos"
  >&#x201B;&#x3BF;&#x3B9;&#x3B1; &#x3BF;&#x3C5;&#x3BA; &#x3B1;&#x3BD;

  &#x201B;&#x3C5;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;&#x3C7;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>),
  cf. my n. on the passage. Thus defined, he most likely tried to show that
  the cognisable was equivalent to the <span lang="el" title="dêlon"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3B7;&#x3BB;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span> or <span lang="el"
  title="pithanon"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3BF;&#x3BD;</span> of Carneades,
  hence he eagerly pressed the doubtful statement of the latter that the
  wise man would "opine," that is, would pronounce definite judgments on
  phenomena. (See <a href="#BkII_78">78</a> of this book.) The scarcity of
  references to Philo in ancient authorities does not allow of a more exact
  view of his doctrine. Modern inquiry has been able to add little or
  nothing to the elucidation given in 1596 by Petrus Valentia in his book
  entitled <i>Academica</i> (pp. 313&mdash;316 of the reprint by Orelli).
  With regard to (3), it it not difficult to see wherein Philo's "lie"
  consisted. He denied the popular view of Arcesilas and Carneades, that
  they were apostles of doubt, to be correct (<a href="#BkII_12">12</a>). I
  may add that from the mention of Philo's ethical works at the outset of
  Stobaeus' <i>Ethica</i>, he would appear to have afterwards left
  dialectic and devoted himself to ethics. What is important for us is,
  that Cic. never seems to have made himself the defender of the new
  Philonian dialectic. By him the dialectic of Carneades is treated as
  genuinely Academic. <i>Revolvitur</i>: cf. <i>De Div.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 13, also <a href="#BkII_148">148</a> of this book.
  <i>Eam definitionem</i>: it is noteworthy that the whole war between the
  sceptics and the dogmatists was waged over the definition of the single
  sensation. Knowledge, it was thought, was a homogeneous compound of these
  sense atoms, if I may so call them, on all hands it was allowed that
  <i>all</i> knowledge ultimately rests on sense; therefore its possibility
  depends on the truth of the individual perception of sense.</p>

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkII_19">§§19</a>&mdash;<a
  href="#BkII_29">29</a>.</b> Summary. If the senses are healthy and
  unimpaired, they give perfectly true information about external things.
  Not that I maintain the truth of <i>every</i> sensation, Epicurus must
  see to that. Things which impede the action of the senses must always be
  removed, in practice we always do remove them where we can (<a
  href="#BkII_19">19</a>). What power the cultivated senses of painters and
  musicians have! How keen is the sense of touch! (<a
  href="#BkII_20">20</a>). After the perceptions of sense come the equally
  clear perceptions of the mind, which are in a certain way perceptions of
  sense, since they come through sense, these rise in complexity till we
  arrive at definitions and ideas (<a href="#BkII_21">21</a>). If these
  ideas may possibly be false, logic memory, and all kinds of arts are at
  once rendered impossible (<a href="#BkII_22">22</a>). That true
  perception is possible, is seen from moral action. Who would act, if the
  things on which he takes action might prove to be false? (<a
  href="#BkII_23">23</a>) How can wisdom be wisdom if she has nothing
  certain to guide her? There must he some ground on which action can
  proceed (<a href="#BkII_24">24</a>). Credence must be given to the thing
  which impels us to action, otherwise action is impossible (<a
  href="#BkII_25">25</a>). The doctrines of the New Academy would put an
  end to all processes of reasoning. The fleeting and uncertain can never
  be discovered. Rational proof requires that something, once veiled,
  should be brought to light (<a href="#BkII_26">26</a>). Syllogisms are
  rendered useless, philosophy too cannot exist unless her dogmas have a
  sure basis (<a href="#BkII_27">27</a>). Hence the Academics have been
  urged to allow their <i>dogma</i> that perception is impossible, to be a
  certain perception of their minds. This, Carneades said, would be
  inconsistent, since the very dogma excludes the supposition that there
  can be <i>any</i> true perception (<a href="#BkII_28">28</a>). Antiochus
  declared that the Academics could not be held to be philosophers if they
  had not even confidence in their one dogma (<a
  href="#BkII_29">29</a>).</blockquote>

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkII_30">§§30</a>&mdash;<a
  href="#BkII_36">36</a>.</b> Summary. With respect to physical science, we
  might urge that nature has constructed man with great art. His mind is
  naturally formed for the attainment of knowledge (<a
  href="#BkII_30">30</a>). For this purpose the mind uses the senses, and
  so gradually arrives at virtue, which is the perfection of the reason.
  Those then who deny that any certainty can be attained through the
  senses, throw the whole of life into confusion (<a
  href="#BkII_31">31</a>). Some sceptics say "we cannot help it." Others
  distinguish between the absolute absence of certainty, and the denial of
  its absolute presence. Let us deal with these rather than with the former
  (<a href="#BkII_32">32</a>). Now they on the one hand profess to
  distinguish between true and false, and on the other hold that no
  absolutely certain method for distinguishing between true and false is
  possible (<a href="#BkII_33">33</a>). This is absurd, a thing cannot be
  known at all unless by such marks as can appertain to no other thing. How
  can a thing be said to be "evidently white," if the possibility remains
  that it may be really black? Again, how can a thing be "evident" at all
  if it may be after all a mere phantom (<a href="#BkII_34">34</a>)? There
  is no definite mark, say the sceptics, by which a thing may be known.
  Their "probability" then is mere random guess work (<a
  href="#BkII_35">35</a>). Even if they only profess to decide after
  careful pondering of the circumstances, we reply that a decision which is
  still possibly false is useless (<a href="#BkII_36">36</a>).</blockquote>

  (R. and P. 411). As the trans. of the latter phrase in Zeller 524
  "probable undisputed and tested" is imperfect, I will give Sextus' own
  explanation. The merely <span lang="el" title="pithanê"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3B9;&#x3B8;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span> is that sensation
  which at first sight, without any further inquiry, seems probably true
  (Sext. <i>A.M.</i> <span class="vol">VII.</span> 167&mdash;175). Now no
  sensation is perceived <i>alone</i>; the percipient subject has always
  other synchronous sensations which are able to turn him aside (<span
  lang="el" title="perispan, perielkein"
  >&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3BD;,
  &#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3B5;&#x3BB;&#x3BA;&#x3B5;&#x3B9;&#x3BD;</span>)
  from the one which is the immediate object of his attention. This last is
  only called <span lang="el" title="aperispastos"
  >&#x3B1;&#x3C0;&#x3B5;&#x3C1;&#x3B9;&#x3C3;&#x3C0;&#x3B1;&#x3C3;&#x3C4;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;</span>
  when examination has shown all the concomitant sensations to be in
  harmony with it. (Sext. as above 175&mdash;181.) The word "undisputed,"
  therefore, is a misleading trans. of the term. The <span lang="el"
  title="diexôdeumenê"
  >&#x3B4;&#x3B9;&#x3B5;&#x3BE;&#x3C9;&#x3B4;&#x3B5;&#x3C5;&#x3BC;&#x3B5;&#x3BD;&#x3B7;</span>
  ("thoroughly explored") requires more than a mere apparent agreement of
  the concomitant sensations with the principal one. Circumstances quite
  external to the sensations themselves must be examined; the time at which
  they occur, or during which they continue; the condition of the space
  within which they occur, and the apparent intervals between the person
  and the objects; the state of the air; the disposition of the person's
  mind, and the soundness or unsoundness of his eyes (Sext.
  181&mdash;189).</p>

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkII_40">§§40</a>&mdash;<a
  href="#BkII_42">42</a>.</b> Summary. The Academics have a regular method.
  They first give a general definition of sensation, and then lay down the
  different classes of sensations. Then they put forward their two strong
  arguments, (1) <i>things</i> which produce <i>sensations</i> such as
  might have been produced in the same form by other <i>things</i>, cannot
  be partly capable of being perceived, partly not capable, (2)
  <i>sensations</i> must be assumed to be of the same form if our faculties
  do not enable us to distinguish between them. Then they proceed.
  Sensations are partly true, partly false, the false cannot of course be
  real <i>perceptions</i>, while the true are always of a form which the
  false <i>may</i> assume. Now sensations which are indistinguishable from
  false cannot be partly perceptions, partly not. There is therefore no
  sensation which is also a perception (<a href="#BkII_40">40</a>). Two
  admissions, they say, are universally made, (1) false sensations cannot
  be perceptions, (2) sensations which are indistinguishable from false,
  cannot be partly perceptions, partly not. The following two assertions
  they strive to prove, (1) sensations are partly true, partly false, (2)
  every sensation which proceeds from a reality, has a form which it might
  have if it proceeded from an unreality (<a href="#BkII_41">41</a>). To
  prove these propositions, they divide perceptions into those which are
  sensations, and those which are deduced from sensations; after which they
  show that credit cannot be given to either class (<a
  href="#BkII_42">42</a>). [The word "perception" is used to mean "a
  certainly known sensation."]</blockquote>

  <i>Totidem verbis</i>: of course with a view to showing that nothing
  really corresponded to the definition. Carneades largely used the
  <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> method. <i>Contineant ... quaestionem</i>:
  cf. <a href="#BkII_22">22</a> and <i>T.D.</i> <span
  class="vol">IV.</span> 65 <i>una res videtur causam continere</i>.
  <i>Quae ita</i>: it is essential throughout this passage to distinguish
  clearly the <i>sensation</i> (<i>visum</i>) from the <i>thing</i> which
  causes it. Here the <i>things</i> are meant; two <i>things</i> are
  supposed to cause two <i>sensations</i> so similar that the person who
  has one of the <i>sensations</i> cannot tell from which of the two
  <i>things</i> it comes. Under these circumstances the sceptics urge that
  it is absurd to divide <i>things</i> into those which can be perceived
  (known with certainty) and those which cannot. <i>Nihil interesse
  autem</i>: the sceptic is not concerned to prove the absolute similarity
  of the two sensations which come from the two dissimilar things, it is
  enough if he can show that human faculties are not perfect enough to
  discern whatever difference may exist, cf. <a href="#BkII_85">85</a>.
  <i>Alia vera sunt</i>: Numenius in Euseb. <i>Pr. Ev.</i> <span
  class="vol">XIV.</span> 8, 4 says Carneades allowed that truth and
  falsehood (or reality and unreality) could be affirmed of <i>things</i>,
  though not of <i>sensations</i>. If we could only pierce <i>through</i> a
  sensation and arrive at its source, we should be able to tell whether to
  believe the sensation or not. As we cannot do this, it is wrong to assume
  that <i>sensation</i> and <i>thing</i> correspond. Cf. Sext. <i>P.H.</i>

  <i>define</i>, for (1) a definition cannot be a definition of two things,
  (2) if the definition is applicable only to one thing, that thing must be
  capable of being thoroughly known and distinguished from others (<a
  href="#BkII_43">43</a>). For the purposes of reasoning their
  <i>probabile</i> is not enough. Reasoning can only proceed upon
  <i>certain</i> premisses. Again to say that there are false sensations is
  to say that there are true ones; you acknowledge therefore a difference,
  then you contradict yourselves and say there is none (<a

  do you not allow what is easier, that two sensations caused by two really
  existing things may be mistaken the one for the other? (<a
  href="#BkII_47">47</a>). Further, they urge that a phantom sensation
  produces very often the same effect as a real one. The dogmatists say
  they admit that mere phantom sensations <i>do</i> command assent. Why
  should they not admit that they command assent when they so closely
  resemble real ones as to be indistinguishable from them? (<a

  follows. The whole is an attempt to prove the proposition announced in <a
  href="#BkII_41">41</a> and <a href="#BkII_42">42</a> viz. <i>omnibus
  veris visis adiuncta esse falsa</i>. The criticism in <a
  href="#BkII_50">50</a> shows that the argument is meant to be based on
  the assumption known to be Stoic, <i>omnia deum posse</i>. If the god can
  manufacture (<i>efficere</i>) sensations which are false, but probable
  (as the Stoics say he does in dreams), why can he not manufacture false
  sensations which are so probable as to closely resemble true ones, or to
  be only with difficulty distinguishable from the true, or finally to be
  utterly indistinguishable from the true (this meaning of <i>inter quae
  nihil sit omnino</i> is fixed by <a href="#BkIIN_40">40</a>, where see
  n.)? <i>Probabilia</i>, then, denotes false sensations such as have only
  a slight degree of resemblance to the true, by the three succeeding
  stages the resemblance is made complete. The word <i>probabilia</i> is a
  sort of tertiary predicate after <i>efficere</i> ("to manufacture so as
  to be probable"). It <i>must not be repeated</i> after the second
  <i>efficere</i>, or the whole sense will be inverted and this section
  placed out of harmony with <a href="#BkII_50">50</a>. <i>Plane

  can be most rationally explained as elliptic constructions in which a
  <i>condition</i> is expressed without its <i>consequence</i>. We have an
  exact parallel in English, e.g. "<i>tu dictis Albane maneres</i>" may
  fairly be translated, "hadst thou but kept to thy word, Alban!" Here the
  condition "<i>if</i> thou hadst kept, etc." stands without the
  consequence "thou wouldst not have died," or something of the kind. Such
  a condition may be expressed without <i>si</i>, just as in Eng. without
  "<i>if</i>," cf. Iuv. <span class="vol">III.</span> 78 and Mayor's n. The
  use of the Greek optative to express a wish (with <span lang="el"
  title="ei gar" >&#x3B5;&#x3B9; &#x3B3;&#x3B1;&#x3C1;</span>, etc., and
  even without <span lang="el" title="ei" >&#x3B5;&#x3B9;</span>) is
  susceptible of the same explanation. The Latin subj. has many such points
  of similarity with the Gk. optative, having absorbed most of the
  functions of the lost Lat. optative. [Madv. on <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">II.</span> 35 seems to imply that he prefers the hypothesis
  of a suppressed protasis, but as in his <i>Gram.</i> 351 <i>b</i>, obs. 4
  he attempts no elucidation, I cannot be certain.]</p>

  doctrines do away with all probability even. Their talk about twins and
  seals is childish (<a href="#BkII_54">54</a>). They press into their
  service the old physical philosophers, though ordinarily none are so much
  ridiculed by them (<a href="#BkII_55">55</a>). Democritus may say that
  innumerable worlds exist in every particular similar to ours, but I
  appeal to more cultivated physicists, who maintain that each thing has
  its own peculiar marks (<a href="#BkII_55">55</a>, <a
  href="#BkII_56">56</a>). The Servilii were distinguished from one another
  by their friends, and Delian breeders of fowls could tell from the
  appearance of an egg which hen had laid it (<a href="#BkII_56">56</a>, <a
  href="#BkII_57">57</a>). We however, do not much care whether we are able
  to distinguish eggs from one another or not. Another thing that they say
  is absurd, viz. that there may be distinction between individual
  sensations, but not between classes of sensations (58). Equally absurd
  are those "probable and undisturbed" sensations they profess to follow.
  The doctrine that true and false sensations are indistinguishable
  logically leads to the unqualified <span lang="el" title="epochê"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C7;&#x3B7;</span> of Arcesilas (59). What
  nonsense they talk about inquiring after the truth, and about the bad
  influence of authority! (60). Can you, Cicero, the panegyrist of
  philosophy, plunge us into more than Cimmerian darkness? (61) By holding
  that knowledge is impossible you weaken the force of your famous oath
  that you "knew all about" Catiline. Thus ended Lucullus, amid the
  continued wonder of Hortensius (62, 63). Then Catulus said that he should
  not be surprised if the speech of Lucullus were to induce me to change my

  est in duobus aut pluribus nulla re differens ulla communitas</i> (<span

  This opinion is negatived by <i>non patitur ut</i> and it will be evident
  at a glance that the only change required is to put the two verbs
  (<i>est</i>) into the subjunctive. The change of <i>ulla</i> into
  <i>nulla</i> is in no way needed. <i>Ut</i> [<i>sibi</i>] <i>sint</i>:
  <i>sibi</i> is clearly wrong here. Madv., in a note communicated
  privately to Halm and printed by the latter on p. 854 of Bait. and Halm's
  ed of the philosophical works, proposed to read <i>nulla re differens
  communitas visi? Sint et ova</i> etc. omitting <i>ulla</i> and <i>ut</i>
  and changing <i>visi</i> into <i>sibi</i> (cf. Faber's em. <i>novas</i>
  for <i>bonas</i> in <a href="#BkIIN_72">72</a>). This ingenious but, as I
  think, improbable conj. Madv. has just repeated in the second vol. of his
  <i>Adversaria</i>. Lamb. reads <i>at tibi sint</i>, Dav. <i>at si vis,
  sint</i>, Christ <i>ut tibi sint</i>, Bait. <i>ut si sint</i> after
  C.F.W. Muller, I should prefer <i>sui</i> for <i>sibi</i> (SVI for SIBI).

  speaks of various doctrines, which were <i>servata et pro mysteriis

  scepticism was merely external and polemically used, while they had an
  esoteric dogmatic doctrine, must have originated in the reactionary
  period of Metrodorus (of Stratonice), Philo, and Antiochus, and may
  perhaps from a passage of Augustine, <i>C. Ac.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 41 (whose authority must have been Cicero), be
  attributed to the first of the three (cf. Zeller 534, n.). The idea is
  ridiculed by Petrus Valentia (Orelli's reprint, p. 279), and all
  succeeding inquirers. <i>Auctoritate</i>: cf. <a href="#BkII_8">8</a>, <a

  this mention of the legendary people. <i>Deus aliquis</i>: so the best
  edd. without comment, although they write <i>deus aliqui</i> in <a

  href="#BkIIN_81">81</a>). As <i>aliquis</i> is substantival,
  <i>aliqui</i> adjectival, <i>aliquis</i> must not be written with
  impersonal nouns like <i>terror</i> (<i>T.D.</i> <span

  23, <span class="vol">IV.</span> 35), <i>deus aliquis</i> (<i>Lael.</i>
  87, <i>Ad Fam.</i> <span class="vol">XIV.</span> 7, 1), <i>anularius

  says, "<i>laudem habet bonae et copiosae memoriae</i>" (on <i>D.F.</i>

  href="#BkII_71">71</a>.</b> Summary. Cic. much moved thus begins. The
  strength of Lucullus argument has affected me much, yet I feel that it
  can be answered. First, however, I must speak something that concerns my
  character (<a href="#BkII_64">64</a>). I protest my entire sincerity in
  all that I say, and would confirm it by an oath, were that proper (<a
  href="#BkII_65">65</a>). I am a passionate inquirer after truth, and on
  that very account hold it disgraceful to assent to what is false. I do
  not deny that I make slips, but we must deal with the <i>sapiens</i>,
  whose characteristic it is never to err in giving his assent (<a
  href="#BkII_66">66</a>). Hear Arcesilas' argument: if the <i>sapiens</i>
  ever gives his assent he will be obliged to <i>opine</i>, but he never
  will <i>opine</i> therefore he never will give his assent. The Stoics and
  Antiochus deny the first of these statements, on the ground that it is
  possible to distinguish between true and false (<a
  href="#BkII_67">67</a>). Even if it be so the mere habit of assenting is
  full of peril. Still, our whole argument must tend to show that
  <i>perception</i> in the Stoic sense is impossible (<a
  href="#BkII_68">68</a>). However, a few words first with Antiochus. When
  he was converted, what proof had he of the doctrine he had so long
  denied? (<a href="#BkII_69">69</a>) Some think he wished to found a
  school called by his own name. It is more probable that he could no
  longer bear the opposition of all other schools to the Academy (<a
  href="#BkII_70">70</a>). His conversion gave a splendid opening for an
  <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> (<a href="#BkII_71">71</a>).</blockquote>

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkII_72">§§72</a>&mdash;<a

  ancient names like a revolutionist, yet Anaxagoras, Democritus, and
  Metrodorus, philosophers of the highest position, protest against the
  truth of sense knowledge, and deny the possibility of knowledge
  altogether (<a href="#BkII_72">72</a>, <a href="#BkII_73">73</a>).
  Empedocles, Xenophanes, and Parmenides all declaim against sense
  knowledge. You said that Socrates and Plato must not be classed with
  these. Why? Socrates said he knew nothing but his own ignorance, while
  Plato pursued the same theme in all his works (<a
  href="#BkII_74">74</a>). Now do you see that I do not merely name, but
  take for my models famous men? Even Chrysippus stated many difficulties
  concerning the senses and general experience. You say he solved them,
  even if he did, which I do not believe, he admitted that it was not easy
  to escape being ensnared by them (<a href="#BkII_75">75</a>). The
  Cyrenaics too held that they knew nothing about things external to
  themselves. The sincerity of Arcesilas may be seen thus (<a
  href="#BkII_76">76</a>). Zeno held strongly that the wise man ought to
  keep clear from <i>opinion</i>. Arcesilas agreed but this without
  <i>knowledge</i> was impossible. <i>Knowledge</i> consists of
  <i>perceptions</i>. Arcesilas therefore demanded a definition of
  <i>perception</i>. This definition Arcesilas combated. This is the
  controversy which has lasted to our time. Do away with <i>opinion</i> and
  <i>perception</i>, and the <span lang="el" title="epochê"

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkII_79">§§79</a>&mdash;<a
  href="#BkII_90">90</a>.</b> Summary You are wrong, Lucullus, in upholding
  your cause in spite of my arguments yesterday against the senses. You are
  thus acting like the Epicureans, who say that the inference only from the
  sensation can be false, not the sensation itself (<a
  href="#BkII_79">79</a>, <a href="#BkII_80">80</a>). I wish the god of
  whom you spoke would ask me whether I wanted anything more than sound
  senses. He would have a bad time with me. For even granting that our
  vision is correct how marvellously circumscribed it is! But say you,
  <i>we</i> desire no more. No I answer, you are like the mole who desires
  not the light because he is blind. Yet I would not so much reproach the
  god because my vision is narrow, as because it deceives me (<a
  href="#BkII_80">80</a>, <a href="#BkII_81">81</a>). If you want something
  greater than the bent oar, what can be greater than the sun? Still he
  seems to us a foot broad, and Epicurus thinks he may be a little broader
  or narrower than he seems. With all his enormous speed, too, he appears
  to us to stand still (<a href="#BkII_82">82</a>). The whole question lies
  in a nutshell; of four propositions which prove my point only one is
  disputed viz. that every true sensation has side by side with it a false
  one indistinguishable from it (<a href="#BkII_83">83</a>). A man who has
  mistaken P. for Q. Geminus could have no infallible mode of recognising
  Cotta. You say that no such indistinguishable resemblances <i>exist</i>.
  Never mind, they <i>seem</i> to exist and that is enough. One mistaken
  sensation will throw all the others into uncertainty (<a
  href="#BkII_84">84</a>). You say everything belongs to its own
  <i>genus</i> this I will not contest. I am not concerned to show that two
  sensations <i>are</i> absolutely similar, it is enough that human
  faculties cannot distinguish between them. How about the impressions of
  signet rings? (<a href="#BkII_85">85</a>) Can you find a ring merchant to
  rival your chicken rearer of Delos? But, you say, art aids the senses. So
  we cannot see or hear without art, which so few can have! What an idea
  this gives us of the art with which nature has constructed the senses!
  (<a href="#BkII_86">86</a>) But about physics I will speak afterwards. I
  am going now to advance against the senses arguments drawn from
  Chrysippus himself (<a href="#BkII_87">87</a>). You said that the
  sensations of dreamers, drunkards and madmen were feebler than those of
  the waking, the sober and the sane. The cases of Ennius and his Alcmaeon,
  of your own relative Tuditanus, of the Hercules of Euripides disprove
  your point (<a href="#BkII_88">88</a>, <a href="#BkII_89">89</a>). In
  their case at least 'mind and eyes agreed. It is no good to talk about
  the saner moments of such people; the question is, what was the nature of
  their sensations at the time they were affected? (<a
  href="#BkII_90">90</a>)</blockquote>

  support, adopted by Orelli. I think the whole confusion of the passage
  arises from the mania of the copyists for turning indicatives into
  subjunctives, of which in critical editions of Cic. exx. occur every few
  pages. If <i>iacet</i> were by error turned into <i>iaceret</i> the
  reading <i>lacerat</i> would arise at once. The nom. to <i>dicit</i> is,
  I may observe, not Epicurus, as Orelli takes it, but Lucullus. Trans.

  Bait. <i>audiet, egerit</i>. <i>Ex hoc loco video ... cerno</i>: MSS.
  have <i>loco cerno regionem video Pompeianum non cerno</i> whence Lipsius
  conj. <i>ex hoc loco e regione video</i>. Halm ejects the words
  <i>regionem video</i>, I prefer to eject <i>cerno regionem</i>. We are
  thus left with the slight change from <i>video</i> to <i>cerno</i>, which
  is very often found in Cic., e.g. <i>Orat.</i> 18. Cic. sometimes however
  joins the two verbs as in <i>De Or.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span>

  <p><b><a name="BkIIN_81"></a><a href="#BkII_81">§81</a>.</b> <i>Nescio

  contempt, while <i>nescio qui</i> does not, cf. <i>Div. in qu. Caec.</i>
  47, where <i>nescio qui</i> would contradict his rule. It is as difficult
  to define the uses of the two expressions as to define those of
  <i>aliquis</i> and <i>aliqui</i>, on which see <a href="#BkIIN_61">61</a>
  n. In <i>Paradoxa</i> 12 the best MSS. have <i>si qui</i> and <i>si

  quotes Solinus and Plin. <i>N.H.</i> <span class="vol">VII.</span> 21, to
  show that the man mentioned here was called Strabo&mdash;a misnomer
  surely. <i>Octingenta</i>: so the best MSS., not <i>octoginta</i>, which
  however agrees better with Pliny. <i>Quod abesset</i>: "<i>whatever</i>
  might be 1800 stadia distant," <i>aberat</i> would have implied that Cic.

  <i>non video cur quaerat amplius</i>. <i>Desideramus</i>: Halm, failing
  to understand the passage, follows Christ in reading <i>desiderant</i>
  (i.e. <i>pisces</i>). To paraphrase the sense is this "But say my
  opponents, the Stoics and Antiocheans, we desire no better senses than we
  have." Well you are like the mole, which does not yearn for the light
  because it does not know what light is. Of course all the ancients
  thought the mole blind. A glance will show the insipidity of the sense
  given by Halm's reading. <i>Quererer cum deo</i>: would enter into an
  altercation with the god. The phrase, like <span lang="el"

  <i>Pro Deiotaro</i> 9 <i>querellae cum Deiotaro</i>. The reading <i>tam

  the fallacy of the <i>sorites</i> and other such sophisms lies entirely

  <i>Orator</i> 73. <i>In acervo tritici</i>: this is the false
  <i>sorites</i>, which may be briefly described thus: A asks B whether one
  grain makes a heap, B answers "No." A goes on asking whether two, three,
  four, etc. grains make a heap. B cannot always reply "No." When he begins
  to answer "Yes," there will be a difference of one grain between heap and
  no heap. One grain therefore <i>does</i> make a heap. The true
  <i>sorites</i> or chain inference is still treated in books on logic, cf.
  Thomson's <i>Laws of Thought</i>, pp 201&mdash;203, ed 8.

  href="#BkII_105">105</a>.</b> Summary. In order to overthrow at once the
  case of Antiochus, I proceed to explain, after Clitomachus, the whole of
  Carneades' system (<a href="#BkII_98">98</a>). Carneades laid down two
  divisions of <i>visa</i>, one into those capable of being perceived and
  those not so capable, the other into probable and improbable. Arguments
  aimed at the senses concern the first division only; the sapiens will
  follow probability, as in many instances the Stoic sapiens confessedly
  does (<a href="#BkII_99">99</a>, <a href="#BkII_100">100</a>). Our
  sapiens is not made of stone; many things <i>seem</i> to him true; yet he
  always feels that there is a possibility of their being false. The Stoics
  themselves admit that the senses are often deceived. Put this admission
  together with the tenet of Epicurus, and perception becomes impossible
  (<a href="#BkII_101">101</a>). It is strange that our <i>Probables</i> do
  not seem sufficient to you. Hear the account given by Clitomachus (<a
  href="#BkII_102">102</a>). He condemns those who say that sensation is
  swept away by the Academy; nothing is swept away but its <i>necessary</i>
  certainty (<a href="#BkII_103">103</a>). There are two modes of
  withholding assent; withholding it absolutely and withholding it merely
  so far as to deny the <i>certainty</i> of phenomena. The latter mode
  leaves all that is required for ordinary life (<a

  <i>Exposuisset adiungit</i>: Madv. on <i>D.F.</i> <span
  class="vol">III.</span> 67 notices a certain looseness in the use of
  tenses, which Cic. displays in narrating the opinions of philosophers,
  but no ex. so strong as this is produced. <i>Ut aut approbet quid aut
  improbet</i>: this Halm rejects. I have noticed among recent editors of
  Cic. a strong tendency to reject explanatory clauses introduced by
  <i>ut</i>. Halm brackets a similar clause in <a href="#BkII_20">20</a>,
  and is followed in both instances by Bait. Kayser, who is perhaps the
  most extensive <i>bracketer</i> of modern times, rejects very many
  clauses of the kind in the Oratorical works. In our passage, the
  difficulty vanishes when we reflect that <i>approbare</i> and
  <i>improbare</i> may mean either to render an <i>absolute</i> approval or
  disapproval, or to render an approval or disapproval merely based on
  <i>probability</i>. For example, in <a href="#BkII_29">29</a> the words
  have the first meaning, in <a href="#BkII_66">66</a> the second. The same
  is the case with <i>nego</i> and <i>aio</i>. I trace the whole difficulty
  of the passage to the absence of terms to express distinctly the
  difference between the two kinds of assent. The general sense will be as
  follows. "There are two kinds of <span lang="el" title="epochê"
  >&#x3B5;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C7;&#x3B7;</span>, one which prevents a man
  from expressing any assent or disagreement (in either of the two senses
  above noticed), another which does not prevent him from giving an answer
  to questions, provided his answer be not taken to imply absolute approval
  or absolute disapproval; the result of which will be that he will neither
  absolutely deny nor absolutely affirm anything, but will merely give a
  qualified 'yes' or 'no,' dependent on probability." My defence of the
  clause impugned is substantially the same as that of Hermann in the
  <i>Philologus</i> (vol. <span class="vol">VII.</span>), which I had not
  read when this note was first written. <i>Alterum placere ... alterum
  tenere</i>: "the one is his formal dogma, the other is his actual
  practice." For the force of this see my note on <i>non probans</i> in <a
  href="#BkIIN_148">148</a>, which passage is very similar to this.
  <i>Neget ... aiat</i>: cf. <a href="#BkII_97">97</a>. <i>Nec ut
  placeat</i>: this, the MSS. reading, gives exactly the wrong sense, for
  Clitomachus <i>did</i> allow such <i>visa</i> to stand as were sufficient
  to serve as a basis for action. Hermann's <i>neu cui</i> labours under
  the same defect. Various emendations are <i>nam cum</i> (Lamb., accepted
  by Zeller 522), <i>hic ut</i> (Manut.), <i>et cum</i> (Dav. followed by
  Bait.), <i>sed cum</i> (Halm). The most probable of these seems to me
  that of Manut. I should prefer <i>sic ut</i>, taking <i>ut</i> in the
  sense of "although." <i>Respondere</i>: "to put in as an answer," as in
  <a href="#BkII_93">93</a> and often. <i>Approbari</i>: sc.
  <i>putavit</i>. Such changes of construction are common in Cic., and I
  cannot follow Halm in altering the reading to <i>approbavit</i>.</p>

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkII_105">§§105</a>&mdash;<a
  href="#BkII_111">111</a>.</b> Summary. You must see, Lucullus, by this
  time, that your defence of dogmatism is overthrown (<a
  href="#BkII_105">105</a>). You asked how memory was possible on my
  principles. Why, did not Siron remember the dogmas of Epicurus? If
  nothing can be remembered which is not absolutely true, then these will
  be true (<a href="#BkII_106">106</a>). Probability is quite sufficient
  basis for the arts. One strong point of yours is that nature compels us
  to <i>assent</i>. But Panaetius doubted even some of the Stoic dogmas,
  and you yourself refuse assent to the <i>sorites</i>, why then should not
  the Academic doubt about other things? (<a href="#BkII_107">107</a>) Your
  other strong point is that without assent action is impossible (<a
  href="#BkII_108">108</a>). But surely many actions of the dogmatist
  proceed upon mere probability. Nor do you gain by the use of the
  hackneyed argument of Antiochus (<a href="#BkII_109">109</a>). Where
  probability is, there the Academic has all the knowledge he wants (<a
  href="#BkII_110">110</a>). The argument of Antiochus that the Academics
  first admit that there are true and false <i>visa</i> and then contradict
  themselves by denying that there is any difference between true and
  false, is absurd. We do not deny that the difference <i>exists</i>; we do
  deny that human faculties are capable of perceiving the difference (<a

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkII_116">§§116</a>&mdash;<a
  href="#BkII_128">128</a>.</b> Summary. Of the three parts of philosophy
  take Physics first. Would your <i>sapiens</i> swear to the truth of any
  geometrical result whatever? (<a href="#BkII_116">116</a>) Let us see
  which one of actual physical systems the <i>sapiens</i> we are seeking
  will select (<a href="#BkII_117">117</a>). He must choose <i>one</i>
  teacher from among the conflicting schools of Thales, Anaximander,
  Anaximenos, Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, Leucippus, Democritus, Empedocles,
  Heraclitus, Melissus, Plato and Pythagoras. The remaining teachers, great
  men though they be, he must reject (<a href="#BkII_118">118</a>).
  Whatever system he selects he must know absolutely; if the Stoic, he must
  believe as strongly in the Stoic theology as he does in the sunlight. If
  he holds this, Aristotle will pronounce him mad; you, however, Lucullus,
  must defend the Stoics and spurn Aristotle from you, while you will not
  allow me even to doubt (<a href="#BkII_119">119</a>). How much better to
  be free, as I am and not compelled to find an answer to all the riddles
  of the universe! (<a href="#BkII_120">120</a>) Nothing can exist, say
  you, apart from the deity. Strato, however, says he does not need the
  deity to construct the universe. His mode of construction again differs
  from that of Democritus. I see some good in Strato, yet I will not assent
  absolutely either to his system or to yours (<a
  href="#BkII_121">121</a>). All these matters lie far beyond our ken. We
  know nothing of our bodies, which we can dissect, while we have not the
  advantage of being able to dissect the constitution of things or of the
  earth to see whether she is firmly fixed or hovers in mid air (<a
  href="#BkII_122">122</a>). Xenophanes, Hicetas, Plato and Epicurus tell
  strange things of the heavenly bodies. How much better to side with
  Socrates and Aristo, who hold that nothing can be known about them! (<a
  href="#BkII_123">123</a>) Who knows the nature of mind? Numberless
  opinions clash, as do those of Dicaearchus, Plato and Xenocrates. Our
  <i>sapiens</i> will be unable to decide (<a href="#BkII_124">124</a>). If
  you say it is better to choose any system rather than none, I choose
  Democritus. You at once upbraid me for believing such monstrous
  falsehoods (<a href="#BkII_125">125</a>). The Stoics differ among
  themselves about physical subjects, why will they not allow me to differ
  from them? (<a href="#BkII_126">126</a>) Not that I deprecate the study
  of Physics, for moral good results from it (<a href="#BkII_127">127</a>).
  Our <i>sapiens</i> will be delighted if he attains to anything which
  seems to resemble truth. Before I proceed to Ethics, I note your weakness
  in placing all perceptions on the same level. You must be prepared to
  asseverate no less strongly that the sun is eighteen times as large as
  the earth, than that yon statue is six feet high. When you admit that all
  things can be perceived no more and no less clearly than the size of the
  sun, I am almost content (<a href="#BkII_128">128</a>).</blockquote>

  of <i>longitudinem</i> which Ursinus, Dav., Orelli, Baiter and others
  propose by conjecture. If anything is to be introduced, I would rather
  add <i>et crassitudine</i> before <i>carentem</i>, comparing <span
  class="vol">I.</span> <a href="#BkI_27">27</a> <i>sine ulla specie et

  <i>carentem</i>, though I feel Halm's remark that a verb is wanted in
  this clause as in the other two, he suggests <i>quod sit sine</i>.
  Hermann takes <i>esse</i> after <i>punctum</i> as strongly predicative

  <i>liniamentum</i> and ejects <i>sine ulla</i>. Observe the awkwardness

  the <i>sapiens</i>, however true he admits the bases of proof to be which

  see Stob. <i>Phys.</i> <span class="vol">XV.</span> 6, Diog. <span

  >&#x3C6;&#x3C5;&#x3C3;&#x3B9;&#x3BA;&#x3B7;</span>, proceeds to give the
  peculiar crotchet of Epic. <i>Putas solem ... tantum</i>: a hard passage.
  <i>Egone? ne bis</i> is the em. of Lamb. for MSS. <i>egone vobis</i>, and
  is approved by Madv., who thus explains it (<i>Em.</i> 185) "<i>cum
  interrogatum esset num tantulum (quasi pedalem <a href="#BkII_82">82</a>)
  solem esse putaret, Epic. non praecise definit (tantum enim esse censebat

  et bipedalem</i>". (<i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">I.</span> 20) This
  explanation though not quite satisfactory is the best yet given.
  Epicurus' absurdity is by Cic. brought into strong relief by stating the
  outside limit to which Epic. was prepared to go in estimating the sun's
  size, i.e. twice the apparent size. <i>Ne ... quidem</i> may possibly
  appear strange, cf. however <i>ne maiorem quidem</i> in <a

  <blockquote><b><a href="#BkII_129">§§129</a>&mdash;<a
  href="#BkII_141">141</a>.</b> Summary. What contention is there among
  philosophers about the ethical standard! I pass by many abandoned systems
  like that of Herillus but consider the discrepancies between Xenophanes,
  Parmenides, Zeno of Elea, Euclides, Menedemus, Aristo, Pyrrho,
  Aristippus, Epicurus, Callipho, Hieronymus, Diodorus, Polemo, Antiochus,
  Carneades (<a href="#BkII_129">129</a>-<a href="#BkII_131">131</a>). If I
  desire to follow the Stoics, Antiochus will not allow me, while if I
  follow Polemo, the Stoics are irate (<a href="#BkII_132">132</a>). I must
  be careful not to assent to the unknown, which is a dogma common to both
  you, Lucullus, and myself (<a href="#BkII_133">133</a>). Zeno thinks
  virtue gives happiness. "Yes," says Antiochus, "but not the greatest
  possible." How am I to choose among such conflicting theories? (<a
  href="#BkII_134">134</a>) Nor can I accept those points in which
  Antiochus and Zeno agree. For instance, they regard emotion as harmful,
  which the ancients thought natural and useful (<a
  href="#BkII_135">135</a>). How absurd are the Stoic Paradoxes! (<a
  href="#BkII_136">136</a>) Albinus joking said to Carneades "You do not
  think me a praetor because I am not a <i>sapiens</i>." "That," said
  Carneades, "is Diogenes' view, not mine" (<a href="#BkII_137">137</a>).
  Chrysippus thinks only three ethical systems can with plausibility be
  defended (<a href="#BkII_138">138</a>). I gravitate then towards one of
  them, that of pleasure. Virtue calls me back, nor will she even allow me
  to join pleasure to herself (<a href="#BkII_139">139</a>). When I hear
  the several pleadings of pleasure and virtue, I cannot avoid being moved
  by both, and so I find it impossible to choose (<a
  href="#BkII_141">141</a>, <a href="#BkII_142">142</a>).</blockquote>

  in <i>D.F.</i> <span class="vol">IV.</span> 14 the <i>finis</i> of Polemo
  is stated to be <i>secundum naturam vivere</i>, and three Stoic
  interpretations of it are given, the last of which resembles the present
  passage&mdash;<i>omnibus aut maximis rebus iis quae secundum naturam sint
  fruentem vivere</i>. This interpretation Antiochus adopted, and from him
  it is attributed to the <i>vetus Academia</i> in <span
  class="vol">I.</span> <a href="#BkI_22">22</a>, where the words <i>aut

  <i>Hic igitur ... prudentior</i>: MSS. generally have <i>assentiens</i>,
  but one good one (Halm's E) has <i>assentientes</i>. I venture to read
  <i>adsentietur</i>, thinking that the last two letters were first dropt,
  as in <a href="#BkII_26">26</a> (<i>tenetur</i>) and that then
  <i>adsentiet</i>, under the attraction of the <i>s</i> following, passed
  into <i>adsentiens</i>, as in <a href="#BkII_147">147</a> <i>intellegat

  <i>sin, inquam</i> (<i>sc. adsentietur</i>) for <i>si numquam</i> of MSS.

  Protagoras, the Cyrenaics, Epicurus, and Plato disagree (<a
  href="#BkII_142">142</a>). Does Antiochus follow any of these? Why, he
  never even follows the <i>vetus Academia</i>, and never stirs a step from
  Chrysippus. Dialecticians themselves cannot agree about the very elements
  of their art (<a href="#BkII_143">143</a>). Why then, Lucullus, do you
  rouse the mob against me like a seditious tribune by telling them I do
  away with the arts altogether? When you have got the crowd together, I
  will point out to them that according to Zeno all of them are slaves,
  exiles, and lunatics, and that you yourself, not being <i>sapiens</i>,
  know nothing whatever (<a href="#BkII_144">144</a>). This last point Zeno
  used to illustrate by action Yet his whole school cannot point to any
  actual <i>sapiens</i> (<a href="#BkII_145">145</a>). Now as there is no
  knowledge there can be no art. How would Zeuxis and Polycletus like this

  certainly mistaken in saying that a laudatory epithet such as
  <i>ingeniosissimi</i> is necessary. I believe that the word
  <i>opiniosissimi</i> (an adj. not elsewhere used by Cic.) was
  manufactured on the spur of the moment, in order to ridicule these two
  philosophers, who are playfully described as men full of <i>opinio</i> or

  ingenious, and if an em. were needed, would not be so utterly improbable

  essentially the same as that involved in <a href="#BkII_104">104</a>,
  which should be closely compared. A contrast is drawn between a
  theoretical dogma and a practical belief. The dogma is that <i>assent</i>
  (meaning absolute assent) is not to be given to phenomena. This dogma
  Catulus might well describe himself as formally approving
  (<i>comprobans</i>). The <i>practice</i> is to give assent (meaning
  modified assent). There is the same contrast in <a
  href="#BkII_104">104</a> between <i>placere</i> and <i>tenere</i>. I may
  note that the word <i>alteri</i> (cf. <i>altero</i> in <a
  href="#BkII_104">104</a>) need not imply that the dogma and the practice
  are irreconcilable; a misconception on this point has considerably
  confirmed edd. in their introduction of the negative. <i>Nec eam
  admodum</i>: cf. <i>non repugnarem</i> in <a href="#BkII_112">112</a>.
  <i>Tollendum</i>: many edd. have gone far astray in interpreting this
  passage. The word is used with a double reference to <i>adsensus</i> and
  <i>ancora</i>; in the first way we have had <i>tollere</i> used a score
  of times in this book; with regard to the second meaning, cf. Caes.
  <i>Bell. Gall.</i> <span class="vol">IV.</span> 23, <i>Bell. Civ.</i>
  <span class="vol">I.</span> 31, where <i>tollere</i> is used of weighing
  anchor, and Varro <i>De Re Rust.</i> <span class="vol">III.</span> 17, 1,
  where it occurs in the sense "to get on," "to proceed," without any
  reference to the sea. (The exx. are from Forc.) This passage I believe
  and this alone is referred to in <i>Ad Att.</i> <span
  class="vol">XIII.</span> 21, 3. If my conjecture is correct, Cic. tried
  at first to manage a joke by using the word <i>inhibendum</i>, which had
  also a nautical signification, but finding that he had mistaken the
  meaning of the word, substituted <i>tollendum</i>.</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
